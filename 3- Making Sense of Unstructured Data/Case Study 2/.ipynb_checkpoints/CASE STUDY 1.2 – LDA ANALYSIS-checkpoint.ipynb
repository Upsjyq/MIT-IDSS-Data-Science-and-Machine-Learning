This has led to pervasive use of cryptography across society. Despite its evident advantages, law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data: client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected, its existence and, potentially, its source, would be revealed to the agencies; otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety debate: it offers privacy -- in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption -- and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this report, we argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents surveillance. Indeed, the effect is the opposite. CSS by its nature creates serious security and privacy risks for all society while the assistance it can provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in which client-side scanning can fail, can be evaded, and can be abused.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        In fetal-brain MRI, head-pose changes between prescription and acquisition present a challenge to obtaining the standard sagittal, coronal and axial views essential to clinical assessment. As motion limits acquisitions to thick slices that preclude retrospective resampling, technologists repeat ~55-second stack-of-slices scans (HASTE) with incrementally reoriented field of view numerous times, deducing the head pose from previous stacks. To address this inefficient workflow, we propose a robust head-pose detection algorithm using full-uterus scout scans (EPI) which take ~5 seconds to acquire. Our ~2-second procedure automatically locates the fetal brain and eyes, which we derive from maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs). The success rate of the method exceeds 94% in the third trimester, outperforming a trained technologist by up to 20%. The pipeline may be used to automatically orient the anatomical sequence, removing the need to estimate the head pose from 2D views and reducing delays during which motion can occur.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods. To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data. Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Image denoising is of great importance for medical imaging system, since it can improve image quality for disease diagnosis and downstream image analyses. In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to capture the time-varying features of the subject, where multiple images are acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised deep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices. Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our method has comparable performance to other state-of-the-art unsupervised or self-supervised denoising methods and outperforms under high noise levels.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        Purpose: To develop a scan-specific model that estimates and corrects k-space errors made when reconstructing accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.\\n  Methods: Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in k-space (SPARK) trains a convolutional-neural-network to estimate and correct k-space errors made by an input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input technique's reconstructed ACS. First, SPARK is applied to GRAPPA and demonstrates improved robustness over other scan-specific models, such as RAKI and residual-RAKI. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that SPARK synergizes with residual-RAKI to improve reconstruction performance. SPARK also improves reconstruction quality when applied to advanced acquisition and reconstruction techniques like 2D virtual coil (VC-) GRAPPA, 2D LORAKS, 3D GRAPPA without an integrated ACS region, and 2D/3D wave-encoded images.\\n  Results: SPARK yields 1.5x - 2x RMSE reduction when applied to GRAPPA and improves robustness to ACS size for various acceleration rates in comparison to other scan-specific techniques. When applied to advanced reconstruction techniques such as residual-RAKI, 2D VC-GRAPPA and LORAKS, SPARK achieves up to 20% RMSE improvement. SPARK with 3D GRAPPA also improves performance by ~2x and perceived image quality without a fully sampled ACS region. Finally, SPARK synergizes with non-cartesian 2D and 3D wave-encoding imaging by reducing RMSE between 20-25% and providing qualitative improvements.\\n  Conclusion: SPARK synergizes with physics-based acquisition and reconstruction techniques to improve accelerated MRI by training scan-specific models to estimate and correct reconstruction errors in k-space.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        Fetal MRI is heavily constrained by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion that causes image artifacts and limits the set of viable diagnostic image contrasts. Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation within 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3%, and a mean error of 6.9 mm.

       " '\\n        We demonstrate that neural network layers that explicitly combine frequency and image feature representations are a versatile building block for analysis of imaging data acquired in the frequency space. Our work is motivated by the challenges arising in MRI acquisition where the signal is a corrupted Fourier transform of the desired image. The joint learning schemes proposed and analyzed in this paper enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that apply learned data manipulations solely in the frequency space or solely in the image space. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning on three diverse tasks: image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, motion correction, and image denoising in brain and knee MRI. We further demonstrate advantages of the joint learning approaches across training schemes using a wide variety of loss functions. Unlike purely image based and purely frequency based architectures, the joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. Joint image and frequency space feature representations promise to significantly improve modeling and reconstruction of images acquired in the frequency space.

The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 200,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6\\\\% and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

Complementary k-space sampling across imaging contrasts and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding were used for data acquisition to improve the reconstruction at high accelerations. At 3T, our joint variational network approach across T1w, T2w and T2-FLAIR-weighted brain scans was tested for retrospective under-sampling at R=6 (2D) and R=4x4 (3D) acceleration. Prospective acceleration was also performed for 3D data where the combined acquisition time for whole brain coverage at 1 mm isotropic resolution across three contrasts was less than three minutes.\\n  Results: Across all test datasets, our joint multi-contrast network better preserved fine anatomical details with reduced image-blurring when compared to the corresponding single-contrast reconstructions. Improvement in image quality was also obtained through complementary k-space sampling and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding where the synergistic combination yielded the overall best performance as evidenced by exemplarily slices and quantitative error metrics.\\n  Conclusion: By leveraging shared anatomical structures across the jointly reconstructed scans, our joint multi-contrast approach learnt more efficient regularizers which helped to retain natural image appearance and avoid over-smoothing. When synergistically combined with advanced encoding techniques, the performance was further improved, enabling up to R=16-fold acceleration with good image quality. This should help pave the way to very rapid high-resolution brain exams.\\n        ',\n",

In addition to avoiding over-smoothing that these techniques often suffer from, we also obviate the need for parameter selection. NDI is flexible enough to allow for reconstruction from an arbitrary number of head orientations, and outperforms COSMOS even when using as few as 1-direction data. This is made possible by a nonlinear forward-model that uses the magnitude as an effective prior, for which we derived a simple gradient descent update rule. We synergistically combine this physics-model with a Variational Network (VN) to leverage the power of deep learning in the VaNDI algorithm. This technique adopts the simple gradient descent rule from NDI and learns the network parameters during training, hence requires no additional parameter tuning. Further, we evaluate NDI at 7T using highly accelerated Wave-CAIPI acquisitions at 0.5 mm isotropic resolution and demonstrate high-quality QSM from as few as 2-direction data.\\n        ',\n",

Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10-30 minutes). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4\\\\% accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.\\n        ',\n",

Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero MRI time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps.

However, today, most ML resources and experts are siloed in a few countries and organizations. In this paper, we describe our pedagogical approach to increasing access to applied ML through a massive open online course (MOOC) on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). We suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an attractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and globally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete, self-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a collaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google) produced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how to develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly available on the edX MOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed for learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to real-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical considerations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of TinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To facilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the courses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional course-project competition. We also released the course materials publicly, hoping they will inspire the next generation of ML practitioners and educators and further broaden access to cutting-edge ML technologies.\\n        ',\n",

Here, we show that rather than using only invariance, pre-training that encourages non-trivial equivariance to some transformations, while maintaining invariance to other transformations, can be used to improve the semantic quality of representations. Specifically, we extend popular SSL methods to a more general framework which we name Equivariant Self-Supervised Learning (E-SSL). In E-SSL, a simple additional pre-training objective encourages equivariance by predicting the transformations applied to the input. We demonstrate E-SSL's effectiveness empirically on several popular computer vision benchmarks.

Such dynamic motion results in significant motion of onboard sensors, which introduces a new set of challenges for real-time visual processing. The requirement for agility and terrain awareness in this setting reinforces the need for robust control. We present Depth-based Impulse Control (DIC), a method for synthesizing highly agile visually-guided locomotion behaviors.

The primary reason is the trade-off between the complexity of designs that is necessary for contact-rich tasks against the practical constraints of manufacturing, optimization, contact handling, etc. We overcome several of these challenges by building an end-to-end differentiable framework for contact-aware robot design. The two key components of this framework are: a novel deformation-based parameterization that allows for the design of articulated rigid robots with arbitrary, complex geometry, and a differentiable rigid body simulator that can handle contact-rich scenarios and computes analytical gradients for a full spectrum of kinematic and dynamic parameters.

When coupled with an auto-decoding framework, it can even support goal specification from camera viewpoints that are outside the training distribution.

A flurry of recent work has asked: why do deep networks not overfit to their training data? In this work, we make a series of empirical observations that investigate the hypothesis that deeper networks are inductively biased to find solutions with lower rank embeddings. We conjecture that this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low-rank embedding increases with depth. We show empirically that our claim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models and show that these are the solutions that generalize well. We then show that the low-rank simplicity bias exists even after training, using a wide variety of commonly used optimizers. We found this phenomenon to be resilient to initialization, hyper-parameters, and learning methods. We further demonstrate how linear over-parameterization of deep non-linear models can be used to induce low-rank bias, improving generalization performance without changing the effective model capacity. Practically, we demonstrate that simply linearly over-parameterizing standard models at training time can improve performance on image classification tasks, including ImageNet.\\n        ',\n",

We show that for rigid bodies, this abstraction can be realized using low-level manipulation skills that maintain sticking contact with the object and represent subgoals as 3D transformations. To enable generalization to unseen objects and improve planning performance, we propose a novel way of representing subgoals for rigid-body manipulation and a graph-attention based neural network architecture for processing point-cloud inputs. We experimentally validate these choices using simulated and real-world experiments on the YuMi robot.

However, in many practical applications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large amounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online environment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline setting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of a variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a continuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors before using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives extracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are supported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding distributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal abstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in theory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline policy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this way can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as exploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.

We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent.

We show that by combining the high and low-level plans, the robot can successfully manipulate a rope into a variety of target shapes using only a sequence of human-provided images for direction.\\n        ',\n",

This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.\\n        ',\n",

This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class? To answer these and related questions, we pre-trained CNN features on various subsets of the ImageNet dataset and evaluated transfer performance on PASCAL detection, PASCAL action classification, and SUN scene classification tasks. Our overall findings suggest that most changes in the choice of pre-training data long thought to be critical do not significantly affect transfer performance.?

Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than 100K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach outperforms alternative methods.\\n        \",\n",

Our models directly process raw visual input, and use a novel object-centric prediction formulation based on visual glimpses centered on objects (fixations) to enforce translational invariance of the learned physical laws. The agent gathers training data through random interaction with a collection of different environments, and the resulting model can then be used to plan goal-directed actions in novel environments that the agent has not seen before.

Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF).

Drawing inspiration from this observation, in this work we investigate if the awareness of egomotion can be used as a supervisory signal for feature learning. As opposed to the knowledge of class labels, information about egomotion is freely available to mobile agents.

Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions in natural scenes. However, all current models of high-level human vision operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern methods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for characterizing brain function.\\n        ',\n",

To address this challenge, much work has studied automatically processing geospatial data sources such as GPS trajectories and satellite images to reduce the cost of maintaining digital maps. An end-to-end map update system would first process geospatial data sources to extract insights, and second leverage those insights to update and improve the map. However, prior work largely focuses on the first step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps), but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to update the existing digital map data. In this paper, we first explain why current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach reduces map update error rates four-fold.\\n        ',\n",

A central feature of such networks is variable communication bandwidth across nodes and across time. We present DispersedLedger, an asynchronous BFT protocol that provides near-optimal throughput in the presence of such variable network bandwidth. The core idea of DispersedLedger is to enable nodes to propose, order, and agree on blocks of transactions without having to download their full content. By enabling nodes to agree on an ordered log of blocks, with a guarantee that each block is available within the network and unmalleable, DispersedLedger decouples bandwidth-intensive block downloads at different nodes, allowing each to make progress at its own pace. We build a full system prototype and evaluate it on real-world and emulated networks.

Recent work has shown that deep learning techniques can rival or outperform human-designed algorithms, but these methods are significantly less compute and power-efficient than existing codecs. This paper presents a new approach that augments existing codecs with a small, content-adaptive super-resolution model that significantly boosts video quality. Our method, SRVC, encodes video into two bitstreams: (i) a content stream, produced by compressing downsampled low-resolution video with the existing codec, (ii) a model stream, which encodes periodic updates to a lightweight super-resolution neural network customized for short segments of the video. SRVC decodes the video by passing the decompressed low-resolution video frames through the (time-varying) super-resolution model to reconstruct high-resolution video frames. Our results show that to achieve the same PSNR, SRVC requires 16% of the bits-per-pixel of H.265 in slow mode, and 2% of the bits-per-pixel of DVC, a recent deep learning-based video compression scheme.

When the GPS trace of an object is available, TagMe matches the object's motion from GPS trace and the pixels' motions in the video to find the pixels belonging to the object in the video and creates the bounding box annotations of the object. TagMe works using passive data collection and can continuously generate new object annotations from outdoor video streams without any human annotators. We evaluate TagMe on a dataset of 100 video clips. We show TagMe can produce high-quality object annotations in a fully-automatic and low-cost way.

Credit networks arise naturally in many financial systems, including the recent construct of payment channel networks in blockchain systems. An important performance metric for these networks is their transaction throughput. However, predicting the throughput of a credit network is nontrivial. Unlike traditional communication channels, credit channels can become imbalanced; they are unable to support more transactions in a given direction once the credit limit has been reached. This potential for imbalance creates a complex dependency between a network's throughput and its topology, path choices, and the credit balances (state) on every channel. Even worse, certain combinations of these factors can lead the credit network to deadlocked states where no transactions can make progress. In this paper, we study the relationship between the throughput of a credit network and its topology and credit state. We show that the presence of deadlocks completely characterizes a network's throughput sensitivity to different credit states. Although we show that identifying deadlocks in an arbitrary topology is NP-hard, we propose a peeling algorithm inspired by decoding algorithms for erasure codes that upper bounds the severity of the deadlock. We use the peeling algorithm as a tool to compare the performance of different topologies as well as to aid in the synthesis of topologies robust to deadlocks.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        The increasing use of cloud computing for latency-sensitive applications has sparked renewed interest in providing tight bounds on network tail latency. Achieving this in practice at reasonable network utilization has proved elusive, due to a combination of highly bursty application demand, faster link speeds, and heavy-tailed message sizes. While priority scheduling can be used to reduce tail latency for some traffic, this comes at a cost of much worse delay behavior for all other traffic on the network. Most operators choose to run their networks at very low average utilization, despite the added cost, and yet still suffer poor tail behavior.\\n  This paper takes a different approach. We build a system, swp, to help operators (and network designers) to understand and control tail latency without relying on priority scheduling. As network workload changes, swp is designed to give real-time advice on the network switch configurations needed to maintain tail latency objectives for each traffic class. The core of swp is an efficient model for simulating the combined effect of traffic characteristics, end-to-end congestion control, and switch scheduling on service-level objectives (SLOs), along with an optimizer that adjusts switch-level scheduling weights assigned to each class. Using simulation across a diverse set of workloads with different SLOs, we show that to meet the same SLOs as swp provides, FIFO would require 65% greater link capacity, and 79% more for scenarios with tight SLOs on bursty traffic classes.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        Previous approaches to learned cardinality estimation have focused on improving average estimation error, but not all estimates matter equally. Since learned models inevitably make mistakes, the goal should be to improve the estimates that make the biggest difference to an optimizer. We introduce a new loss function, Flow-Loss, that explicitly optimizes for better query plans by approximating the optimizer's cost model and dynamic programming search algorithm with analytical functions. At the heart of Flow-Loss is a reduction of query optimization to a flow routing problem on a certain plan graph in which paths correspond to different query plans. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the Cardinality Estimation Benchmark, which contains the ground truth cardinalities for sub-plans of over 16K queries from 21 templates with up to 15 joins. We show that across different architectures and databases, a model trained with Flow-Loss improves the cost of plans (using the PostgreSQL cost model) and query runtimes despite having worse estimation accuracy than a model trained with Q-Error. When the test set queries closely match the training queries, both models improve performance significantly over PostgreSQL and are close to the optimal performance (using true cardinalities). However, the Q-Error trained model degrades significantly when evaluated on queries that are slightly different (e.g., similar but not identical query templates), while the Flow-Loss trained model generalizes better to such situations. For example, the Flow-Loss model achieves up to 1.5x better runtimes on unseen templates compared to the Q-Error model, despite leveraging the same model architecture and training data.\\n        \",\n",

However, this optimization is only available to queries that filter on the indexed attribute. To extend these speedups to queries on other attributes, database systems have turned to secondary and multi-dimensional indexes. Unfortunately, these approaches are restrictive: secondary indexes have a large memory footprint and can only speed up queries that access a small number of records, and multi-dimensional indexes cannot scale to more than a handful of columns. We present Cortex, an approach that takes advantage of correlations to extend the reach of primary indexes to more attributes. Unlike prior work, Cortex can adapt itself to any existing primary index, whether single or multi-dimensional, to harness a broad variety of correlations, such as those that exist between more than two attributes or have a large number of outliers. We demonstrate that on real datasets exhibiting these diverse types of correlations, Cortex matches or outperforms traditional secondary indexes with $5\\\\times$ less space, and it is $2-8\\\\times$ faster than existing approaches to indexing correlations.\\n        ',\n",

In the Internet today, however, there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under the control of the data sender. To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections and their control loops intact. Enforcing this sending rate ensures that bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift from the bottleneck to the sendbox. The sendbox then exercises control over its traffic by scheduling packets to achieve higher-level objectives. We have implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation experiments. We find that Bundler allows the sender-chosen policy to be effective: when configured to implement Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ), it improves median flow completion time (FCT) by between 28% and 97% across various scenarios.\\n        \",\n",

We find that these two approaches have complementary strengths while suffering from their own inherent limitations.\\n  In this paper, we propose a new method, Sat2Graph, which combines the advantages of the two prior categories into a unified framework. The key idea in Sat2Graph is a novel encoding scheme, graph-tensor encoding (GTE), which encodes the road graph into a tensor representation. GTE makes it possible to train a simple, non-recurrent, supervised model to predict a rich set of features that capture the graph structure directly from an image. We evaluate Sat2Graph using two large datasets. We find that Sat2Graph surpasses prior methods on two widely used metrics, TOPO and APLS.

Recent work on learned multi-dimensional indexes has introduced the idea of automatically optimizing an index for a particular dataset and workload. However, the performance of that work suffers in the presence of correlated data and skewed query workloads, both of which are common in real applications.

Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.\\n        ',\n",

We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.\\n        ',\n",

Several recently proposed learning-based approaches achieve promising results on simple channel models (e.g., i.i.d. Gaussian). However, their performance degrades significantly on real-world channels with spatial correlation. We propose MMNet, a deep learning MIMO detection scheme that significantly outperforms existing approaches on realistic channels with the same or lower computational complexity. MMNet's design builds on the theory of iterative soft-thresholding algorithms and uses a novel training algorithm that leverages temporal and spectral correlation to accelerate training. Together, these innovations allow MMNet to train online for every realization of the channel. On i.i.d. Gaussian channels, MMNet requires two orders of magnitude fewer operations than existing deep learning schemes but achieves near-optimal performance. On spatially-correlated channels, it achieves the same error rate as the next-best learning scheme (OAMPNet) at 2.5dB lower SNR and with at least 10x less computational complexity. MMNet is also 4--8dB better overall than a classic linear scheme like the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector.\\n        \",\n",

ABC routers mark each packet with an \"accelerate\" or \"brake\", which causes senders to slightly increase or decrease their congestion windows. Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.\\n        ',\n",

Neo bootstraps its query optimization model from existing optimizers and continues to learn from incoming queries, building upon its successes and learning from its failures. Furthermore, Neo naturally adapts to underlying data patterns and is robust to estimation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neo, even when bootstrapped from a simple optimizer like PostgreSQL, can learn a model that offers similar performance to state-of-the-art commercial optimizers, and in some cases even surpass them.\\n        ',\n",

Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network have emerged as a viable scaling solution. However, completing payments on PCNs is challenging: payments must be routed on paths with sufficient funds. As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the channel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that direction; hence, naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system. Today\\'s PCNs also route payments atomically, worsening the problem. In this paper, we present Spider, a routing solution that \"packetizes\" transactions and uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows Spider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels over time, while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations comparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires less than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on balanced traffic demands, and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on imbalanced demands.\\n        ',\n",

Therefore, policy gradient methods with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training. We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that depends on a long sequence of inputs.

This is because key-value caches need to frequently insert, update and evict small objects.

These excessive writes and erasures significantly shorten the lifetime of flash, rendering it impractical to use for key-value caches. We present Flashield, a hybrid key-value cache that uses DRAM as a \"filter\" to minimize writes to SSD. Flashield performs light-weight machine learning profiling to predict which objects are likely to be read frequently before getting updated; these objects, which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large chunks sequentially.

Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.\\n        ',\n",

We develop an interface that describes formats in terms of their capabilities and properties, and show how to build a modular code generator where new formats can be added as plugins. We then describe six implementations of the interface that compose to form the dense, CSR/CSF, COO, DIA, ELL, and HASH tensor formats and countless variants thereof. With these implementations at hand, our code generator can generate code to compute any tensor algebra expression on any combination of the aforementioned formats.\\n  To demonstrate our technique, we have implemented it in the taco tensor algebra compiler. Our modular code generator design makes it simple to add support for new tensor formats, and the performance of the generated code is competitive with hand-optimized implementations. Furthermore, by extending taco to support a wider range of formats specialized for different application and data characteristics, we can improve end-user application performance. For example, if input data is provided in the COO format, our technique allows computing a single matrix-vector multiplication directly with the data in COO, which is up to 3.6$\\\\times$ faster than by first converting the data to CSR.\\n        ',\n",

These heuristics are fragile, local and typically only present one vectorization strategy that is either accepted or rejected by a cost model. We present goSLP, a novel SLP auto-vectorization framework which solves the statement packing problem in a pairwise optimal manner. Using an integer linear programming (ILP) solver, goSLP searches the entire space of statement packing opportunities for a whole function at a time, while limiting total compilation time to a few minutes. Furthermore, goSLP optimally solves the vector permutation selection problem using dynamic programming. We implemented goSLP in the LLVM compiler infrastructure, achieving a geometric mean speedup of 7.58% on SPEC2017fp, 2.42% on SPEC2006fp and 4.07% on NAS benchmarks compared to LLVM's existing SLP auto-vectorizer.\\n        \",\n",

Tiramisu introduces a novel three-level IR that separates the algorithm, how that algorithm is executed, and where intermediate data are stored. This separation simplifies optimization and makes targeting multiple hardware architectures from the same algorithm easier. As a result, DSL compilers can be made considerably less complex with no loss of performance while immediately targeting multiple hardware or hardware combinations such as distributed nodes with both CPUs and GPUs.

We show that Tiramisu extends Halide and Julia with many new capabilities including the ability to: express new algorithms (such as recurrent filters and non-rectangular iteration spaces), perform new complex loop nest transformations (such as wavefront parallelization, loop shifting and loop fusion) and generate efficient code for more architectures (such as combinations of distributed clusters, multicores, GPUs and FPGAs). Finally, we demonstrate that Tiramisu can generate very efficient code that matches the highly optimized Intel MKL gemm (generalized matrix multiplication) implementation, we also show speedups reaching 4X in Halide and 16X in Julia due to optimizations enabled by Tiramisu.\\n        ',\n",

Weld exposes a lazily-evaluated API where diverse functions can submit their computations in a simple but general intermediate representation that captures their data-parallel structure. It then optimizes data movement across these functions and emits efficient code for diverse hardware.

Previous systems have applied out-of-core processing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary. However, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because of the much smaller performance gap between DRAM and cache. We present two techniques that take advantage of the cache with minimal or no instruction overhead. The first, frequency based clustering, groups together frequently accessed vertices to improve the utilization of each cache line with no runtime overhead. The second, CSR segmenting, partitions the graph to restrict all random accesses to the cache, makes all DRAM access sequential, and merges partition results using a very low overhead cache-aware merge. Both techniques can be easily implemented on top of optimized graph frameworks.

We show that RNN and transformer language models exhibit structured, consistent generalization in out-of-distribution contexts. We begin by introducing two idealized models of generalization in next-word prediction: a local context model in which generalization is consistent with the last word observed, and a global context model in which generalization is consistent with the global structure of the input. In experiments in English, Finnish, Mandarin, and random regular languages, we demonstrate that neural language models interpolate between these two forms of generalization: their predictions are well-approximated by a log-linear combination of local and global predictive distributions. We then show that, in some languages, noise mediates the two forms of generalization: noise applied to input tokens encourages global generalization, while noise in history representations encourages local generalization. Finally, we offer a preliminary theoretical explanation of these results by proving that the observed interpolation behavior is expected in log-linear models with a particular feature correlation structure. These results help explain the effectiveness of two popular regularization schemes and show that aspects of sequence model generalization can be understood and controlled.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of subspace regularization schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 22% on the miniImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); these further improve accuracy by up to 2%.

Our approach is built from three components: (1) automatic identification of perceptually salient directions based on their layer selectivity; (2) human annotation of these directions with free-form, compositional natural language descriptions; and (3) decomposition of these annotations into a visual concept vocabulary, consisting of distilled directions labeled with single words.

We describe how to train this model using primarily unannotated demonstrations by parsing demonstrations into sequences of named high-level subtasks, using only a small number of seed annotations to ground language in action. In trained models, the space of natural language commands indexes a combinatorial library of skills; agents can use these skills to plan by generating high-level instruction sequences tailored to novel goals. We evaluate this approach in the ALFRED household simulation environment, providing natural language annotations for only 10% of demonstrations.

Here we learn an approximate execution model implemented as a modular neural network. By constructing compositional program representations that implicitly encode the interpretation semantics of the underlying programming language, we can represent partial programs using a flexible combination of concrete execution state and learned neural representations, using the learned approximate semantics when concrete semantics are not known (in unfinished parts of the program). We show that these hybrid neuro-symbolic representations enable execution-guided synthesizers to use more powerful language constructs, such as loops and higher-order functions, and can be used to synthesize programs more accurately for a given search budget than pure neural approaches in several domains.\\n        ',\n",

We extend these models to tasks with sequential structure. Evaluation of language generation and interpretation shows that pragmatic inference improves state-of-the-art listener models (at correctly interpreting human instructions) and speaker models (at producing instructions correctly interpreted by humans) in diverse settings.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many recent successes, but our understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich environments in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and correspondingly diagnose individual actions against such a characterization. Here we consider a family of combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos, Selfridge, and Spencer, and we propose their use as environments for evaluating and comparing different approaches to reinforcement learning. These games have a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but test for generalization, make comparisons to supervised learning, analyse multiagent play, and even develop a self play algorithm.

Can this linguistic background knowledge improve the generality and efficiency of learned classifiers and control policies? This paper aims to show that using the space of natural language strings as a parameter space is an effective way to capture natural task structure. In a pretraining phase, we learn a language interpretation model that transforms inputs (e.g. images) into outputs (e.g. labels) given natural language descriptions. To learn a new concept (e.g. a classifier), we search directly in the space of descriptions to minimize the interpreter's loss on training examples. Crucially, our models do not require language data to learn these concepts: language is used only in pretraining to impose structure on subsequent learning. Results on image classification, text editing, and reinforcement learning show that, in all settings, models with a linguistic parameterization outperform those without.\\n        \",\n",

Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener.

For example, to answer \"is there an equal number of balls and boxes?\" we can look for balls, look for boxes, count them, and compare the results. The recently proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) architecture implements this approach to question answering by parsing questions into linguistic substructures and assembling question-specific deep networks from smaller modules that each solve one subtask. However, existing NMN implementations rely on brittle off-the-shelf parsers, and are restricted to the module configurations proposed by these parsers rather than learning them from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module Networks (N2NMNs), which learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific network layouts without the aid of a parser. Our model learns to generate network structures (by imitating expert demonstrations) while simultaneously learning network parameters (using the downstream task loss). Experimental results on the new CLEVR dataset targeted at compositional question answering show that N2NMNs achieve an error reduction of nearly 50% relative to state-of-the-art attentional approaches, while discovering interpretable network architectures specialized for each question.\\n        ',\n",

Understanding these relationships is essential for interpreting and grounding such natural language expressions. Most prior work focuses on either grounding entire referential expressions holistically to one region, or localizing relationships based on a fixed set of categories. In this paper we instead present a modular deep architecture capable of analyzing referential expressions into their component parts, identifying entities and relationships mentioned in the input expression and grounding them all in the scene. We call this approach Compositional Modular Networks (CMNs): a novel architecture that learns linguistic analysis and visual inference end-to-end. Our approach is built around two types of neural modules that inspect local regions and pairwise interactions between regions.

To learn from sketches, we present a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor--critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals. Experiments show that using our approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly adapt to new tasks.\\n        ',\n",

Like inference-driven approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior when selecting utterances.

The problem of fast normalizer computation has therefore attracted significant attention in the theoretical and applied machine learning literature. In this paper, we analyze a recently proposed technique known as \"self-normalization\", which introduces a regularization term in training to penalize log normalizers for deviating from zero. This makes it possible to use unnormalized model scores as approximate probabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that self-normalization is extremely effective, but a theoretical understanding of why it should work, and how generally it can be applied, is largely lacking. We prove generalization bounds on the estimated variance of normalizers and upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to self-normalization, describe classes of input distributions that self-normalize easily, and construct explicit examples of high-variance input distributions. Our theoretical results make predictions about the difficulty of fitting self-normalized models to several classes of distributions, and we conclude with empirical validation of these predictions.\\n        ',\n",

Long-range polar or anti-polar order of such permanent dipoles gives rise to ferroelectricity or antiferroelectricity, respectively. However, the recently discovered antiferroelectrics of fluorite structure (HfO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$) are different: A non-polar phase transforms into a polar phase by spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking upon the application of an electric field. Here, we show that this structural transition in antiferroelectric ZrO$_2$ gives rise to a negative capacitance, which is promising for overcoming the fundamental limits of energy efficiency in electronics. Our findings provide insight into the thermodynamically 'forbidden' region of the antiferroelectric transition in ZrO$_2$ and extend the concept of negative capacitance beyond ferroelectricity.

In the context of reduced order models of high-dimensional time-dependent fluid systems, machine learning methods grant the benefit of automated learning from data, but the burden of a model lies on its reduced-order representation of both the fluid state and physical dynamics. In this work, we build a physics-constrained, data-driven reduced order model for the Navier-Stokes equations to approximate spatio-temporal turbulent fluid dynamics. The model design choices mimic numerical and physical constraints by, for example, implicitly enforcing the incompressibility constraint and utilizing continuous Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for tracking the evolution of the differential equation. We demonstrate this technique on three-dimensional, moderate Reynolds number turbulent fluid flow. In assessing the statistical quality and characteristics of the machine-learned model through rigorous diagnostic tests, we find that our model is capable of reconstructing the dynamics of the flow over large integral timescales, favoring accuracy at the larger length scales. More significantly, comprehensive diagnostics suggest that physically-interpretable model parameters, corresponding to the representations of the fluid state and dynamics, have attributable and quantifiable impact on the quality of the model predictions and computational complexity.\\n        ',\n",

We then amplify these zero-shot translations by using them as few-shot demonstrations for sampling a larger synthetic dataset. This dataset is distilled by discarding the few-shot demonstrations and then fine-tuning. During backtranslation, we repeatedly generate translations for a set of inputs and then fine-tune a single language model on both directions of the translation task at once, ensuring cycle-consistency by swapping the roles of gold monotext and generated translations when fine-tuning.

However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences.

While the TT format makes these problems tractable, iterative techniques for solving the PDEs must be adapted to perform arithmetic while maintaining the implicit structure. The fundamental operation used to maintain feasible memory and computational time is called rounding, which truncates the internal ranks of a tensor already in TT format. We propose several randomized algorithms for this task that are generalizations of randomized low-rank matrix approximation algorithms and provide significant reduction in computation compared to deterministic TT-rounding algorithms. Randomization is particularly effective in the case of rounding a sum of TT-tensors (where we observe 20x speedup), which is the bottleneck computation in the adaptation of GMRES to vectors in TT format.

In this paper, we demonstrate that RoseTTAFold does not exhibit such a robustness despite its high accuracy, and biologically small perturbations for some input sequences result in radically different predicted protein structures. This raises the challenge of detecting when these predicted protein structures cannot be trusted. We define the robustness measure for the predicted structure of a protein sequence to be the inverse of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) in the predicted structure and the structure of its adversarially perturbed sequence. We use adversarial attack methods to create adversarial protein sequences, and show that the RMSD in the predicted protein structure ranges from 0.119√Ö to 34.162√Ö when the adversarial perturbations are bounded by 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance. This demonstrates very high variance in the robustness measure of the predicted structures. We show that the magnitude of the correlation (0.917) between our robustness measure and the RMSD between the predicted structure and the ground truth is high, that is, the predictions with low robustness measure cannot be trusted.

       " '\\n        The training of neural networks using different deep learning frameworks may lead to drastically differing accuracy levels despite the use of the same neural network architecture and identical training hyperparameters such as learning rate and choice of optimization algorithms. Currently, our ability to build standardized deep learning models is limited by the availability of a suite of neural network and corresponding training hyperparameter benchmarks that expose differences between existing deep learning frameworks. In this paper, we present a living dataset of models and hyperparameters, called CrossedWires, that exposes semantic differences between two popular deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and Tensorflow. The CrossedWires dataset currently consists of models trained on CIFAR10 images using three different computer vision architectures: VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 across a large hyperparameter space. Using hyperparameter optimization, each of the three models was trained on 400 sets of hyperparameters suggested by the HyperSpace search algorithm. The CrossedWires dataset includes PyTorch and Tensforflow models with test accuracies as different as 0.681 on syntactically equivalent models and identical hyperparameter choices. The 340 GB dataset and benchmarks presented here include the performance statistics, training curves, and model weights for all 1200 hyperparameter choices, resulting in 2400 total models. The CrossedWires dataset provides an opportunity to study semantic differences between syntactically equivalent models across popular deep learning frameworks. Further, the insights obtained from this study can enable the development of algorithms and tools that improve reliability and reproducibility of deep learning frameworks.

       " '\\n        Deep Neural Networks are actively being used in the design of autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The advantage of these models is their ability to handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate representations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that the sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire state space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will likely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution. These conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for the safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or the feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control action to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD condition. In this paper, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series OOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially across short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data distribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of multi-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for CPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference times. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single $Œ≤$-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent space sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive latent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most likely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset called nuImages.\\n        ',\n",

With Human Activity Recognition (HAR), applications could track if a patient took his pills and detect the behavioral changes associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. Current systems for HAR require diverse sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, proximity sensors, and accelerometers) placed throughout the environment to provide detailed observations needed for high-accuracy HAR. The difficulty of instrumenting an environment with these sensors makes this approach impractical.\\n  This project considers whether recent advances in indoor localization (Wi-Fi Round Trip Time) enable high-accuracy HAR using only a smartphone. My design, called Location-Enhanced HAR (LEHAR), uses machine learning to combine acceleration, audio, and location data to detect common human activities. A LEHAR prototype, designed to recognize a dozen common activities conducted in a typical household, achieved an F1-score of 0.965. In contrast, existing approaches, which use only acceleration or audio data, obtained F1-scores of 0.660 and 0.865, respectively, on the same activities. In addition, the F1-score of existing designs dropped significantly as more activities were added for recognition, while LEHAR was able to maintain high accuracy. The results show that using a combination of acceleration, audio, and Wi-Fi Round Trip Time localization can enable a highly accurate and easily deployable HAR system.\\n        \",\n",

Clearly, it is no easier than k-SAT, and might be harder. Indeed, via simple reductions we show NP-hardness for k=2 and W[1]-hardness parameterized by the co-dimension of the subspace. We also prove that the optimization version Max-2-SUB-SAT is NP-hard to approximate better than the trivial 3/4 ratio even on satisfiable instances.\\n  On the algorithmic front, we investigate fast exponential algorithms which give non-trivial savings over brute-force algorithms. We give a simple branching algorithm with runtime 1.5^r for 2-SUB-SAT, where $r$ is the subspace dimension and an O^*(1.4312)^n time algorithm where $n$ is the number of variables.\\n  For k more than 2, while known algorithms for solving a system of degree $k$ polynomial equations already imply a solution with runtime 2^{r(1-1/2k)}, we explore a more combinatorial approach. For instance, based on the notion of critical variables, we give an algorithm with running time ${n\\\\choose {\\\\le t}} 2^{n-n/k}$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $t$ is the co-dimension of the subspace. This improves upon the running time of the polynomial equations approach for small co-dimension.

How simulation can best contribute to scientific insight about RS alongside qualitative and quantitative empirical approaches is an open question. Philosophers and researchers have long debated the epistemological nature of simulation compared to wholly theoretical or empirical methods. Simulation is often implicitly or explicitly conceptualized as occupying a middle ground between empirical and theoretical approaches, allowing researchers to realize the benefits of both. However, what is often ignored in such arguments is that without firm grounding in any single methodological tradition, simulation studies have no agreed upon scientific norms or standards, resulting in a patchwork of theoretical motivations, approaches, and implementations that are difficult to reconcile. In this position paper, we argue that simulation studies of RS are conceptually similar to empirical experimental approaches and therefore can be evaluated using the standards of empirical research methods. Using this empirical lens, we argue that the combination of high heterogeneity in approaches and low transparency in methods in simulation studies of RS has limited their interpretability, generalizability, and replicability. We contend that by adopting standards and practices common in empirical disciplines, simulation researchers can mitigate many of these weaknesses.\\n        ',\n",

One source of uncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training and test scenarios. Detecting such distribution shifts in real-time is an emerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in CPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task. Generative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we studied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the latter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a focus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can robustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by the latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice, we tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's robustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our methods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to driving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also generalized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the real-world and simulation driving data sets experimented. Finally, we customized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed to resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection.

Despite the complexity of building data-driven ROMs for turbulence, the superior representational capacity of deep neural networks has demonstrated considerable success in learning ROMs. Nevertheless, these strategies are typically devoid of physical foundations and often lack interpretability. Conversely, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based Galerkin projection (GP) approach for ROM has been popular in many problems owing to its theoretically consistent and explainable physical foundations. However, a key limitation is that the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arising from GP ROMs are highly susceptible to instabilities due to truncation of POD modes and lead to deterioration in temporal predictions. In this work, we propose a \\\\textit{differentiable programming} approach that blends the strengths of both these strategies, by embedding neural networks explicitly into the GP ODE structure, termed Neural Galerkin projection. We demonstrate this approach on the isentropic Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flow over a cavity at a moderate Mach number. When provided the structure of the projected equations, we show that the Neural Galerkin approach implicitly learns stable ODE coefficients from POD coefficients and demonstrates significantly longer and accurate time horizon predictions, when compared to the classical POD-GP assisted by calibration. We observe that the key benefits of this differentiable programming-based approach include increased flexibility in physics-based learning, very low computational costs, and a significant increase in interpretability, when compared to purely data-driven neural networks.\\n        ',\n",

However, prior work largely focuses on the first step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps), but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to update the existing digital map data. In this paper, we first explain why current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach reduces map update error rates four-fold.\\n        ',\n",

A mobility platform should allocate tasks to vehicles and schedule them in order to optimize both throughput and fairness across customers. However, existing approaches to scheduling tasks in mobility platforms ignore fairness.\\n  We introduce Mobius, a system that uses guided optimization to achieve both high throughput and fairness across customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally diverse and dynamic customer demands. It provides a principled method to navigate inherent tradeoffs between fairness and throughput caused by shared mobility. Our evaluation demonstrates these properties, along with the versatility and scalability of Mobius, using traces gathered from ridesharing and aerial sensing applications. Our ridesharing case study shows that Mobius can schedule more than 16,000 tasks across 40 customers and 200 vehicles in an online manner.\\n        ',\n",

However, creating these data-sets is time-consuming and expensive since it relies on human annotators. We design, implement, and evaluate TagMe, a new approach for automatic object annotation in videos that uses GPS data. When the GPS trace of an object is available, TagMe matches the object's motion from GPS trace and the pixels' motions in the video to find the pixels belonging to the object in the video and creates the bounding box annotations of the object. TagMe works using passive data collection and can continuously generate new object annotations from outdoor video streams without any human annotators. We evaluate TagMe on a dataset of 100 video clips. We show TagMe can produce high-quality object annotations in a fully-automatic and low-cost way. Compared with the traditional human-in-the-loop solution, TagMe can produce the same amount of annotations at a much lower cost, e.g., up to 110x.\\n        \",\n",

To support such apps, Apple and Google have released Exposure Notification Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to infer device (user) proximity using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) team has shown that accurately estimating the distance between devices using only BLE radio signals is challenging.

In the Internet today, however, there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under the control of the data sender. To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections and their control loops intact. Enforcing this sending rate ensures that bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift from the bottleneck to the sendbox. The sendbox then exercises control over its traffic by scheduling packets to achieve higher-level objectives. We have implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation experiments. We find that Bundler allows the sender-chosen policy to be effective: when configured to implement Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ), it improves median flow completion time (FCT) by between 28% and 97% across various scenarios.\\n        \",\n",

Prior solutions fall into two categories: (1) pixel-wise segmentation-based approaches, which predict whether each pixel is on a road, and (2) graph-based approaches, which predict the road graph iteratively. We find that these two approaches have complementary strengths while suffering from their own inherent limitations.\\n  In this paper, we propose a new method, Sat2Graph, which combines the advantages of the two prior categories into a unified framework. The key idea in Sat2Graph is a novel encoding scheme, graph-tensor encoding (GTE), which encodes the road graph into a tensor representation. GTE makes it possible to train a simple, non-recurrent, supervised model to predict a rich set of features that capture the graph structure directly from an image. We evaluate Sat2Graph using two large datasets. We find that Sat2Graph surpasses prior methods on two widely used metrics, TOPO and APLS. Furthermore, whereas prior work only infers planar road graphs, our approach is capable of inferring stacked roads (e.g., overpasses), and does so robustly.\\n        ',\n",

Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.\\n        ',\n",

However, in many parts of the world, street maps are incomplete or lag behind new construction. Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.\\n  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street maps.\\n  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to address these challenges, which we combined into a new system we call Mapster. Mapster is a human-in-the-loop street map editing system that incorporates three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional tools and workflows: high-precision automatic map inference, data refinement, and machine-assisted map editing.\\n  Through an evaluation on a large-scale dataset including satellite imagery, GPS trajectories, and ground-truth map data in forty cities, we show that Mapster makes automation practical for map editing, and enables the curation of map datasets that are more complete and up-to-date at less cost.\\n        ',\n",

We propose machine-assisted map editing, where automatic map inference is integrated into existing, human-centric map editing workflows. To realize this, we build Machine-Assisted iD (MAiD), where we extend the web-based OpenStreetMap editor, iD, with machine-assistance functionality. We complement MAiD with a novel approach for inferring road topology from aerial imagery that combines the speed of prior segmentation approaches with the accuracy of prior iterative graph construction methods. We design MAiD to tackle the addition of major, arterial roads in regions where existing maps have poor coverage, and the incremental improvement of coverage in regions where major roads are already mapped. We conduct two user studies and find that, when participants are given a fixed time to map roads, they are able to add as much as 3.5x more roads with MAiD.\\n        ',\n",

Many modern systems beamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to direct its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Unfortunately practical challenges limit the size of modern radios, and consequently, their ability to beamform. In many settings, radios on devices must be small and inexpensive; today, these settings are unable to benefit from high-precision beamforming.\\n  To address this problem, we introduce RFocus, which moves beamforming functions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a two-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple elements, each of which functions as an RF switch. Each element either lets the signal through or reflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the elements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a receiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength measurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an inexpensive thin wallpaper, requiring no wiring. This solution requires only a method to communicate received signal strengths periodically to the RFocus controller. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by 10.5x, and the median channel capacity by 2.1x.\\n        \",\n",

ABC routers mark each packet with an \"accelerate\" or \"brake\", which causes senders to slightly increase or decrease their congestion windows. Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we ask whether monetary incentives can help attract peers in P2P content delivery systems. We commissioned a professional survey of people around theUnited States to answer several relevant questions. We found that 51% of the 876 respondents--substantially larger than our expectations--answered \"yes\" to whether they would participate for suitable financial incentives. Encouraged by the results of the survey, we propose Gringotts, a system to structure incentives and securely incorporate P2P delivery into content delivery systems.

If cross traffic is inelastic, then a sender can control queueing delays while achieving high throughput, but in the presence of elastic traffic, it may lose throughput if it attempts to control packet delay. To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow\\'s sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Nimbus detects the nature of the cross traffic more accurately than Copa, and is usable as a building block by other end-to-end algorithms.\\n        ',\n",

While we can tweak scheduling parameters, we cannot modify algorithmic logic, or add a completely new algorithm, after the switch has been designed. This paper presents a design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling algorithms---potentially algorithms that are unknown today---to be programmed into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.\\n  Our design builds on the observation that scheduling algorithms make two decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them. Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.\\n  We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a detailed hardware design for this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch with <4% chip area overhead on a 16-nm standard-cell library. Our design lets us program many sophisticated algorithms, such as a 5-level hierarchical scheduler with programmable scheduling algorithms at each level.\\n        ',\n",

The key challenge is that these algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. The key idea to achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms is the notion of a packet transaction : a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms.

They are the first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel. We present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the framework of an efficient sequential code.

In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers.

Recently, this limitation was lifted by cascade energy transfer, in which the absorption and quality factor are modulated with wavelength, enabling non-resonant pumping of high-quality micro-lasers and solar-pumped laser to operate at record low solar concentration. Here, we present a generic theoretical framework for modeling the absorption, emission and energy transfer of incoherent radiation between cascade sensitizer and laser gain media. Our model is based on linear equations of the modified net radiation method and is therefore robust, fast converging and has low complexity. We apply this formalism to compute the optimal parameters of low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. It is revealed that the interplay between the absorption and self-absorption of such lasers defines the optimal pump absorption below the maximal value, which is in contrast to conventional lasers for which full pump absorption is desired. Numerical results are compared to experimental data on a sensitized Nd:YAG cavity, and quantitative agreement with theoretical models is found.

These Dirac cones may open up in energy by simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting energy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which travel at the interface of this plexcitonic system.

This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances.

We propose to approximate this family of encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks and show that NeuraCrypt achieves competitive accuracy to non-private baselines on a variety of x-ray tasks.

In this work, we present CATs -- Confident Adaptive Transformers -- in which we simultaneously increase computational efficiency, while guaranteeing a specifiable degree of consistency with the original model with high confidence. Our method trains additional prediction heads on top of intermediate layers, and dynamically decides when to stop allocating computational effort to each input using a meta consistency classifier. To calibrate our early prediction stopping rule, we formulate a unique extension of conformal prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on four classification and regression tasks.\\n        ',\n",

The key challenge in creating such summaries is the lack of large parallel training data required for training typical summarization systems. To this end, we introduce a hybrid generation approach inspired by traditional concept-to-text systems. To enable accurate comparison between different sources, the model first learns to extract pertinent relations from input documents. The content planning component uses deterministic operators to aggregate these relations after identifying a subset for inclusion into a summary. The surface realization component lexicalizes this information using a text-infilling language model. By separately modeling content selection and realization, we can effectively train them with limited annotations.

In order to adapt, models must be sensitive to subtle differences in supporting evidence. We present VitaminC, a benchmark infused with challenging cases that require fact verification models to discern and adjust to slight factual changes. We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions that modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with additional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000 claim-evidence pairs. Unlike previous resources, the examples in VitaminC are contrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in language and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while the other does not. We show that training using this design increases robustness -- improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6% on adversarial natural language inference (NLI). Moreover, the structure of VitaminC leads us to define additional tasks for fact-checking resources: tagging relevant words in the evidence for verifying the claim, identifying factual revisions, and providing automatic edits via factually consistent text generation.\\n        ',\n",

In this work, we obtain substantially tighter prediction sets while maintaining desirable marginal guarantees by casting conformal prediction as a meta-learning paradigm over exchangeable collections of auxiliary tasks. Our conformalization algorithm is simple, fast, and agnostic to the choice of underlying model, learning algorithm, or dataset.

In this task, we use question-answer (QA) pairs---a natural expression of information need---from users, instead of reference captions, for both training and post-inference evaluation. We show that it is possible to use reinforcement learning to directly optimize for the intended information need, by rewarding outputs that allow a question answering model to provide correct answers to sampled user questions. We convert several visual question answering datasets into CapWAP datasets, and demonstrate that under a variety of scenarios our purposeful captioning system learns to anticipate and fulfill specific information needs better than its generic counterparts, as measured by QA performance on user questions from unseen images, when using the caption alone as context.\\n        ',\n",

We capture the natural phonological geometry by learning character embeddings based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The resulting generative framework jointly models word segmentation and cognate alignment, informed by phonological constraints. We evaluate the model on both deciphered languages (Gothic, Ugaritic) and an undeciphered one (Iberian). The experiments show that incorporating phonetic geometry leads to clear and consistent gains. Additionally, we propose a measure for language closeness which correctly identifies related languages for Gothic and Ugaritic.

In the standard CP paradigm, the predicted set can often be unusably large and also costly to obtain. This is particularly pervasive in settings where the correct answer is not unique, and the number of total possible answers is high. We first expand the CP correctness criterion to allow for additional, inferred \"admissible\" answers, which can substantially reduce the size of the predicted set while still providing valid performance guarantees. Second, we amortize costs by conformalizing prediction cascades, in which we aggressively prune implausible labels early on by using progressively stronger classifiers -- again, while still providing valid performance guarantees.

To generate cell features at different resolutions and scale to high-resolution images, we develop a novel multi-scale flow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid. To maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the molecular interventions, we devise a training strategy based on contrastive learning. To evaluate our model, we propose a new set of metrics for biological image generation that are robust, interpretable, and relevant to practitioners.

A key consideration in building neural models for this task is aligning model design with strategies adopted by chemists. Building on this viewpoint, this paper introduces a graph-based approach that capitalizes on the idea that the graph topology of precursor molecules is largely unaltered during a chemical reaction. The model first predicts the set of graph edits transforming the target into incomplete molecules called synthons. Next, the model learns to expand synthons into complete molecules by attaching relevant leaving groups. This decomposition simplifies the architecture, making its predictions more interpretable, and also amenable to manual correction.

Towards this goal, we successfully combine optimal transport (OT) with parametric graph models. Graph representations are obtained from Wasserstein distances between the set of GNN node embeddings and ``prototype'' point clouds as free parameters. We theoretically prove that, unlike traditional sum aggregation, our function class on point clouds satisfies a fundamental universal approximation theorem. Empirically, we address an inherent collapse optimization issue by proposing a noise contrastive regularizer to steer the model towards truly exploiting the OT geometry.

Moreover, natural environments in these tasks are structured, defined by complex descriptors such as molecular scaffolds or protein families. Therefore, most environments are either never seen during training, or contain only a single training example. To address these challenges, we propose a new regret minimization (RGM) algorithm and its extension for structured environments. RGM builds from invariant risk minimization (IRM) by recasting simultaneous optimality condition in terms of predictive regret, finding a representation that enables the predictor to compete against an oracle with hindsight access to held-out environments. The structured extension adaptively highlights variation due to complex environments via specialized domain perturbations. We evaluate our method on multiple applications: molecular property prediction, protein homology and stability prediction and show that RGM significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.\\n        ',\n",

While several approaches to UQ have been proposed in the literature, there is no clear consensus on the comparative performance of these models. In this paper, we study this question in the context of regression tasks. We systematically evaluate several methods on five benchmark datasets using multiple complementary performance metrics. Our experiments show that none of the methods we tested is unequivocally superior to all others, and none produces a particularly reliable ranking of errors across multiple datasets. While we believe these results show that existing UQ methods are not sufficient for all common use-cases and demonstrate the benefits of further research, we conclude with a practical recommendation as to which existing techniques seem to perform well relative to others.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn predictors that can generalize or extrapolate beyond the heterogeneous data. Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization, adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data, molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening data for SARS-CoV-1.

Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in absolute gain.

These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest.

Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule.

It iteratively determines which word to place in a blank and whether to insert new blanks, and stops generating when no blanks are left to fill. BLM can be efficiently trained using a lower bound of the marginal data likelihood.

However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks demonstrating the stylistic similarity between malicious and legitimate uses of LMs, employed in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings.

Thus, rather than learning solely from words, our model also leverages their distributional signatures, which encode pertinent word occurrence patterns. Our model is trained within a meta-learning framework to map these signatures into attention scores, which are then used to weight the lexical representations of words. We demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prototypical networks learned on lexical knowledge (Snell et al., 2017) in both few-shot text classification and relation classification by a significant margin across six benchmark datasets (20.0% on average in 1-shot classification).\\n        ',\n",

Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for training the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model. The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence.

In this paper, we introduce GraphIE, a framework that operates over a graph representing a broad set of dependencies between textual units (i.e. words or sentences). The algorithm propagates information between connected nodes through graph convolutions, generating a richer representation that can be exploited to improve word-level predictions. Evaluation on three different tasks --- namely textual, social media and visual information extraction --- shows that GraphIE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence tagging model by a significant margin.\\n        ',\n",

Our central hypothesis is that this mapping is general across domains, and thus can be transferred from resource-rich domains to low-resource ones. Our model jointly learns a domain-invariant representation and induces the desired mapping between rationales and attention.

Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network.

The current solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space, but it suffers from coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a template-free approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center, we can directly enumerate candidate products. The generated candidates are scored by a Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule.

Specifically, by learning to ground the meaning of text to the dynamics of the environment such as transitions and rewards, an autonomous agent can effectively bootstrap policy learning on a new domain given its description. We employ a model-based RL approach consisting of a differentiable planning module, a model-free component and a factorized state representation to effectively use entity descriptions.

This includes the maximum count rate, latency, jitter, and quantum efficiency. Despite its importance, the study of TBC in superconducting nanowire devices has not been done systematically, primarily due to the lack of a straightforward characterization method. Here, we show that simple electrical measurements can be used to estimate the TBC between nanowires and substrates and that these measurements match acoustic mismatch theory across a variety of substrates.

This device takes advantage of the multiplexing capability of the KID, allowing for a natural frequency multiplexed readout. The Kinetic Inductance Magnetometer (KIM) is biased with a DC magnetic flux through the inductive loop. A perturbing signal will cause a flux change through the loop, and thus a change in the induced current, which alters the kinetic inductance of the nanowires, causing the resonant frequency of the KIM to shift.

One limitation of the technique is, however, that the composition of overlapping tissue needs to be interpolated from a region surrounding the lesion. The purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate that lesion characterization can be done with spectral tomosynthesis, and to investigate whether the 3D information available in tomosynthesis can reduce the uncertainty from the interpolation of surrounding tissue. A phantom experiment was designed to simulate a cyst and a tumor, where the tumor was overlaid with a structure that made it mimic a cyst. In 2D, the two targets appeared similar in composition, whereas spectral tomosynthesis revealed the exact compositional difference. However, the loss of discrimination signal due to spread from the plane of interest was of the same strength as the reduction of anatomical noise. Results from a preliminary investigation on clinical tomosynthesis images of solid lesions yielded results that were consistent with the phantom experiments, but were still to some extent inconclusive. We conclude that lesion characterization is feasible in spectral tomosynthesis, but more data, as well as refinement of the calibration and discrimination algorithms, are needed to draw final conclusions about the benefit compared to 2D.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Spectral imaging is the acquisition of multiple images of an object at different energy spectra. In mammography, dual-energy imaging (spectral imaging with two energy levels) has been investigated for several applications, in particular material decomposition, which allows for quantitative analysis of breast composition and quantitative contrast-enhanced imaging. Material decomposition with dual-energy imaging is based on the assumption that there are two dominant photon interaction effects that determine linear attenuation: the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. This assumption limits the number of basis materials, i.e. the number of materials that are possible to differentiate between, to two. However, Rayleigh scattering may account for more than 10% of the linear attenuation in the mammography energy range. In this work, we show that a modified version of a scanning multi-slit spectral photon-counting mammography system is able to acquire three images at different spectra and can be used for triple-energy imaging. We further show that triple-energy imaging in combination with the efficient scatter rejection of the system enables measurement of Rayleigh scattering, which adds an additional energy dependency to the linear attenuation and enables material decomposition with three basis materials. Three available basis materials have the potential to improve virtually all applications of spectral imaging.\\n        ',\n",

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate a method for measuring the volumetric breast density using photon-counting spectral tomosynthesis. The performance of the method was evaluated using phantom measurements and clinical data from a small population (n=18). The precision was determined to 2.4 percentage points (pp) of volumetric breast density. Strong correlations were observed between contralateral (R^2=0.95) and ipsilateral (R^2=0.96) breast-density measurements. The measured breast density was anti-correlated to breast thickness, as expected, and exhibited a skewed distribution in the range [3.7%, 55%] and with a median of 18%. We conclude that the method yields promising results that are consistent with expectations. The relatively high precision of the method may enable novel applications such as treatment monitoring.\\n        ',\n",

We also identify a particular dimensionless ratio of potential to kinetic energies as a key coupling constant. This coupling establishes characteristic length and time scales for a large class of low energy quantum states, and it guides the choice of step sizes in numerical work. Using the BCH method in conjunction with an imaginary time rotation, we compute low energy eigenstates for several quantum systems coupled to non-trivial background potentials.

Mathematically, this \"natural\" algorithm is a form of Newton\\'s method for solving Bellman\\'s equation, but Newton\\'s method, contrary to the case of single-player DP problems, is not globally convergent in the case of a minimax problem, because the Bellman operator may have components that are neither convex nor concave. Our algorithms address this difficulty by introducing alternating player choices, and by using a policy-dependent mapping with a uniform sup-norm contraction property, similar to earlier works by Bertsekas and Yu [BeY10], [BeY12], [YuB13]. Moreover, our algorithms allow a convergent and highly parallelizable implementation, which is based on state space partitioning, and distributed asynchronous policy evaluation and policy improvement operations within each set of the partition. Our framework is also suitable for the use of reinforcement learning methods based on aggregation, which may be useful for large-scale problem instances.\\n        ',\n",

The algorithm converges in a finite number of stages to a type of locally optimal policy, and suggests the possibility of variants of PI and multiagent PI where the policy improvement is simplified.

Our methods specifically address the computational challenges of partially observable multiagent problems. In particular: 1) We consider rollout algorithms that dramatically reduce required computation while preserving the key cost improvement property of the standard rollout method. The per-step computational requirements for our methods are on the order of $O(Cm)$ as compared with $O(C^m)$ for standard rollout, where $C$ is the maximum cardinality of the constraint set for the control component of each agent, and $m$ is the number of agents. 2) We show that our methods can be applied to challenging problems with a graph structure, including a class of robot repair problems whereby multiple robots collaboratively inspect and repair a system under partial information. 3) We provide a simulation study that compares our methods with existing methods, and demonstrate that our methods can handle larger and more complex partially observable multiagent problems (state space size $10^{37}$ and control space size $10^{7}$, respectively). Finally, we incorporate our multiagent rollout algorithms as building blocks in an approximate policy iteration scheme, where successive rollout policies are approximated by using neural network classifiers.

As a result, the amount of computation for each policy improvement grows linearly with the number of agents, as opposed to exponentially for the standard all-agents-at-once method. For the case of a finite-state discounted problem, we showed convergence to an agent-by-agent optimal policy.

We show that the cost improvement property is maintained with an alternative implementation that has greatly reduced computational requirements, and makes possible the use of rollout in problems with many agents. We demonstrate this alternative algorithm by applying it to layered graph problems that involve both a spatial and a temporal structure. We consider in some detail a prominent example of such problems: multidimensional assignment, where we use the auction algorithm for 2-dimensional assignment as a base heuristic. This auction algorithm is particularly well-suited for our context, because through the use of prices, it can advantageously use the solution of an assignment problem as a starting point for solving other related assignment problems, and this can greatly speed up the execution of the rollout algorithm.\\n        \",\n",

The classical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\\\\equiv0$, but our scheme works best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal cost function $J^*$.\\n  When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_Œº$ of some known policy $Œº$ and there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout algorithm based on $Œº$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement starting with the policy $Œº$). When $V=J_Œº$ and there are multiple aggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form of improvement of $Œº$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy evaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form of approximate policy iteration.\\n  When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to approximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local correction within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are obtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an arbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states is sufficiently large.

In the absence of these assumptions, the results are weaker and unusual in character: the optimal cost function need not be a solution of Bellman's equation, and an optimal policy may not be found by value or policy iteration. Instead the optimal cost function over just the contractive policies solves Bellman's equation, and can be computed by a variety of algorithms.\\n        \",\n",

With a fixed agent policy, we demonstrate that an optimal adversary to perturb state observations can be found, which is guaranteed to obtain the worst case agent reward. For DRL settings, this leads to a novel empirical adversarial attack to RL agents via a learned adversary that is much stronger than previous ones. To enhance the robustness of an agent, we propose a framework of alternating training with learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary online together with the agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework. Additionally, inspired by the analysis of state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), we show that past states and actions (history) can be useful for learning a robust agent, and we empirically find a LSTM based policy can be more robust under adversaries. Empirical evaluations on a few continuous control environments show that ATLA achieves state-of-the-art performance under strong adversaries.

Since the observations deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making suboptimal actions. Several works have shown this vulnerability via adversarial attacks, but existing approaches on improving the robustness of DRL under this setting have limited success and lack for theoretical principles. We show that naively applying existing techniques on improving robustness for classification tasks, like adversarial training, is ineffective for many RL tasks. We propose the state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP) to study the fundamental properties of this problem, and develop a theoretically principled policy regularization which can be applied to a large family of DRL algorithms, including proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and deep Q networks (DQN), for both discrete and continuous action control problems.

Several existing approaches utilize linear relaxation based neural network output bounds under perturbation, but they can slow down training by a factor of hundreds depending on the underlying network architectures. Meanwhile, interval bound propagation (IBP) based training is efficient and significantly outperforms linear relaxation based methods on many tasks, yet it may suffer from stability issues since the bounds are much looser especially at the beginning of training. In this paper, we propose a new certified adversarial training method, CROWN-IBP, by combining the fast IBP bounds in a forward bounding pass and a tight linear relaxation based bound, CROWN, in a backward bounding pass. CROWN-IBP is computationally efficient and consistently outperforms IBP baselines on training verifiably robust neural networks.

Formal robustness verification of decision tree ensembles involves finding the exact minimal adversarial perturbation or a guaranteed lower bound of it. Existing approaches find the minimal adversarial perturbation by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which takes exponential time so is impractical for large ensembles. Although this verification problem is NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree, and for tree ensembles, the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique problem on a multi-partite graph with bounded boxicity. For low dimensional problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a polynomial time algorithm. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of the graph, we develop an efficient multi-level verification algorithm that can give tight lower bounds on the robustness of decision tree ensembles, while allowing iterative improvement and any-time termination. OnRF/GBDT models trained on 10 datasets, our algorithm is hundreds of times faster than the previous approach that requires solving MILPs, and is able to give tight robustness verification bounds on large GBDTs with hundreds of deep trees.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we show that tree based models are also vulnerable to adversarial examples and develop a novel algorithm to learn robust trees. At its core, our method aims to optimize the performance under the worst-case perturbation of input features, which leads to a max-min saddle point problem. Incorporating this saddle point objective into the decision tree building procedure is non-trivial due to the discrete nature of trees --- a naive approach to finding the best split according to this saddle point objective will take exponential time. To make our approach practical and scalable, we propose efficient tree building algorithms by approximating the inner minimizer in this saddle point problem, and present efficient implementations for classical information gain based trees as well as state-of-the-art tree boosting models such as XGBoost. Experimental results on real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can substantially improve the robustness of tree-based models against adversarial examples.\\n        ',\n",

In our paper, we shed some lights on the practicality and the hardness of adversarial training by showing that the effectiveness (robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with the distance between a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by the network. Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks, the \"blind-spot attack\", where the input images reside in \"blind-spots\" (low density regions) of the empirical distribution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we find that blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Wong & Kolter, 2018) and (Sinha et al., 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only be practically optimized on a limited set of training data.\\n        ',\n",

Current available methods of computing such a bound are either time-consuming or delivering low quality bounds that are too loose to be useful. In this paper, we exploit the special structure of ReLU networks and provide two computationally efficient algorithms Fast-Lin and Fast-Lip that are able to certify non-trivial lower bounds of minimum distortions, by bounding the ReLU units with appropriate linear functions Fast-Lin, or by bounding the local Lipschitz constant Fast-Lip. Experiments show that (1) our proposed methods deliver bounds close to (the gap is 2-3X) exact minimum distortion found by Reluplex in small MNIST networks while our algorithms are more than 10,000 times faster; (2) our methods deliver similar quality of bounds (the gap is within 35% and usually around 10%; sometimes our bounds are even better) for larger networks compared to the methods based on solving linear programming problems but our algorithms are 33-14,000 times faster; (3) our method is capable of solving large MNIST and CIFAR networks up to 7 layers with more than 10,000 neurons within tens of seconds on a single CPU core.\\n  In addition, we show that, in fact, there is no polynomial time algorithm that can approximately find the minimum $\\\\ell_1$ adversarial distortion of a ReLU network with a $0.99\\\\ln n$ approximation ratio unless $\\\\mathsf{NP}$=$\\\\mathsf{P}$, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network.\\n        ',\n",

We prove that functions satisfying this property can be learned in polynomial time using layerwise stochastic coordinate descent on regular neural networks -- a class of network architectures and initializations that have homogeneity properties. Our analysis shows that for such staircase functions and neural networks, the gradient-based algorithm learns high-level features by greedily combining lower-level features along the depth of the network. We further back our theoretical results with experiments showing that staircase functions are also learnable by more standard ResNet architectures with stochastic gradient descent.

Concretely, we aim to learn a model such that posteriors $P(X_i|X_S)$ for small sets of variables $S$ are accurate. Since its introduction more than 50 years ago, the Chow-Liu algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum likelihood tree, has been the benchmark algorithm for learning tree-structured graphical models. A bound on the sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm with respect to the prediction-centric local total variation loss was shown in [BK19]. While those results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even when recovering the true underlying graph is impossible, their bound depends on the maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the information-theoretic optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that carefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric reconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models under a prediction-centric loss.

Using variants of the planted clique conjecture for specific forms of secret leakage planted clique, we deduce tight statistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems including robust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions, robust sparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic block models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense subgraph, detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for learning sparse mixtures. In particular, a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of the planted clique conjecture is sufficient to establish all of our computational lower bounds. Our techniques also reveal novel connections to combinatorial designs and to random matrix theory. This work gives the first evidence that an expanded set of hardness assumptions, such as for secret leakage planted clique, may be a key first step towards a more complete theory of reductions among statistical problems.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We develop a corrective mechanism for neural network approximation: the total available non-linear units are divided into multiple groups and the first group approximates the function under consideration, the second group approximates the error in approximation produced by the first group and corrects it, the third group approximates the error produced by the first and second groups together and so on. This technique yields several new representation and learning results for neural networks. First, we show that two-layer neural networks in the random features regime (RF) can memorize arbitrary labels for arbitrary points under under Euclidean distance separation condition using $\\\\tilde{O}(n)$ ReLUs which is optimal in $n$ up to logarithmic factors. Next, we give a powerful representation result for two-layer neural networks with ReLUs and smoothed ReLUs which can achieve a squared error of at most $Œµ$ with $O(C(a,d)Œµ^{-1/(a+1)})$ for $a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\cup\\\\{0\\\\}$ when the function is smooth enough (roughly when it has $Œò(ad)$ bounded derivatives). In certain cases $d$ can be replaced with effective dimension $q \\\\ll d$. Previous results of this type implement Taylor series approximation using deep architectures. We also consider three-layer neural networks and show that the corrective mechanism yields faster representation rates for smooth radial functions. Lastly, we obtain the first $O(\\\\mathrm{subpoly}(1/Œµ))$ upper bound on the number of neurons required for a two layer network to learn low degree polynomials up to squared error $Œµ$ via gradient descent. Even though deep networks can express these polynomials with $O(\\\\mathrm{polylog}(1/Œµ))$ neurons, the best learning bounds on this problem require $\\\\mathrm{poly}(1/Œµ)$ neurons.\\n        ',\n",

A fundamental initial question regarding these models is: when are these random graphs affected by their latent geometry and when are they indistinguishable from simpler models without latent structure, such as the Erd≈ës-R√©nyi graph $\\\\mathcal{G}(n, p)$? We address this question for two of the most well-studied models of random graphs with latent geometry -- the random intersection and random geometric graph.\\n  Our results are as follows: (1) we prove that the random intersection graph converges in total variation to $\\\\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ when $d = \\\\tildeœâ(n^3)$, and does not if $d = o(n^3)$, resolving an open problem in Fill et al.

A main feature of our approach is to map to these problems via a common intermediate problem that we introduce, which we call Imbalanced Sparse Gaussian Mixtures. We assume the planted clique conjecture for a version of the planted clique problem where the position of the planted clique is mildly constrained, and from this obtain the following computational lower bounds: (1) a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-computational gap for robust sparse mean estimation, providing the first average-case evidence for a conjecture of Li (2017) and Balakrishnan et al. (2017); (2) a tight lower bound for semirandom planted dense subgraph, which shows that a semirandom adversary shifts the detection threshold in planted dense subgraph to the conjectured recovery threshold; and (3) a universality principle for $k$-to-$k^2$ gaps in a broad class of sparse mixture problems that includes many natural formulations such as the spiked covariance model.\\n  Our main approach is to introduce several average-case techniques to produce structured and Gaussianized versions of an input graph problem, and then to rotate these high-dimensional Gaussians by matrices carefully constructed from hyperplanes in $\\\\mathbb{F}_r^t$. For our universality result, we introduce a new method to perform an algorithmic change of measure tailored to sparse mixtures. We also provide evidence that the mild promise in our variant of planted clique does not change the complexity of the problem.\\n        ',\n",

We prove the following:\\n  1. Dense Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: Counting $k$-cliques on $G(n,c,s)$ with $k$ and $c$ constant matches its worst-case time complexity up to a $\\\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor. Assuming randomized ETH, it takes $n^{Œ©(k)}$ time to count $k$-cliques in $G(n,c,s)$ if $k$ and $c$ are constant.\\n  2. Sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: When $c = Œò(n^{-Œ±})$, we give several algorithms exploiting the sparsity of $G(n, c, s)$ that are faster than the best known worst-case algorithms. Complementing this, based on a fine-grained worst-case assumption, our results imply a different average-case phase diagram for each fixed $Œ±$ depicting a tradeoff between a runtime lower bound and $k$. Surprisingly, in the hypergraph case ($s \\\\ge 3$), these lower bounds are tight against our algorithms exactly when $c$ is above the Erd≈ës-R√©nyi $k$-clique percolation threshold.\\n  This is the first worst-case-to-average-case hardness reduction for a problem on Erd≈ës-R√©nyi hypergraphs that we are aware of.

       " '\\n        In the past decade, sparse principal component analysis has emerged as an archetypal problem for illustrating statistical-computational tradeoffs. This trend has largely been driven by a line of research aiming to characterize the average-case complexity of sparse PCA through reductions from the planted clique (PC) conjecture - which conjectures that there is no polynomial-time algorithm to detect a planted clique of size $K = o(N^{1/2})$ in $\\\\mathcal{G}(N, \\\\frac{1}{2})$. All previous reductions to sparse PCA either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade with the exponent in the PC conjecture. Specifically, when only given the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^Œ±)$ where $Œ±< 1/2$, there is no sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $Œ±\\\\le 1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a statistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$. We give a reduction from PC that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that weaker forms of the PC conjecture up to clique size $K = o(N^Œ±)$ for any given $Œ±\\\\in (0, 1/2]$ imply tight computational lower bounds for sparse PCA at sparsities $k = o(n^{Œ±/3})$. This shows that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for PC is subpolynomial. This is the first instance of a suboptimal hardness assumption implying optimal lower bounds for another problem in unsupervised learning.\\n        ',\n",

This formulation includes a number of well-studied problems, such as biclustering when $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is a principal minor and $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ are Bernoulli random variables. These problems all seem to exhibit a universal phenomenon: there is a statistical-computational gap depending on $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at which it can be solved in polynomial time. Our main result is to tightly characterize this computational barrier as a tradeoff between $k$ and the KL divergences between $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ through average-case reductions from the planted clique conjecture. These computational lower bounds hold given mild assumptions on $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ arising naturally from classical binary hypothesis testing. Our results recover and generalize the planted clique lower bounds for Gaussian biclustering in Ma-Wu (2015) and Brennan et al.

A variety of algorithms have been proposed for both SPCA and SLR, but an explicit connection between the two had not been made. We show how to efficiently transform a black-box solver for SLR into an algorithm for SPCA: assuming the SLR solver satisfies prediction error guarantees achieved by existing efficient algorithms such as those based on the Lasso, the SPCA algorithm derived from it achieves near state of the art guarantees for testing and for support recovery for the single spiked covariance model as obtained by the current best polynomialtime algorithms. Our reduction not only highlights the inherent similarity between the two problems, but also, from a practical standpoint, allows one to obtain a collection of algorithms for SPCA directly from known algorithms for SLR. We provide experimental results on simulated data comparing our proposed framework to other algorithms for SPCA.\\n        ',\n",

Many of these problems exhibit an intriguing phenomenon: the amount of data needed by all known computationally efficient algorithms far exceeds what is needed for inefficient algorithms that search over all possible structures. A line of work initiated by Berthet and Rigollet in 2013 has aimed to explain these statistical-computational gaps by reducing from conjecturally hard average-case problems in computer science. However, the delicate nature of average-case reductions has limited the applicability of this approach. In this work we introduce several new techniques to give a web of average-case reductions showing strong computational lower bounds based on the planted clique conjecture using natural problems as intermediates. These include tight lower bounds for Planted Independent Set, Planted Dense Subgraph, Sparse Spiked Wigner, Sparse PCA, a subgraph variant of the Stochastic Block Model and a biased variant of Sparse PCA.

While there are algorithms with provable guarantees for learning undirected graphical models in a variety of settings, there has been much less progress in the important scenario when there are latent variables. Here we study Restricted Boltzmann Machines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature extraction and deep learning.\\n  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of learning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables: ferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot. In particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence maximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn a description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random Field. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were developed to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends straighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.\\n  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with constant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse parity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising characterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the distribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF. This result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of deep belief networks.\\n        ',\n",

The system dynamics follow the stochastic Ising model (SIM) over a 2-dimensional $\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\times\\\\sqrt{n}$ grid. The initial spin configuration $X_0$ serves as the user-controlled input. The output configuration $X_t$ is produced by running $t$ steps of Glauber dynamics.

While $\\\\sqrt{n}$ is order optimal for infinite time, backing off to $t<\\\\infty$, higher orders of $I_n(t)$ are achievable. First, linear coding arguments imply that $I_n(t) = Œò(n)$ for $t=O(n)$.

Our goal is to test without knowing the parameter values of the underlying models: only the \\\\emph{structure} of dependencies is known. We develop a new approach that applies to both the Ising and Exponential Random Graph settings based on a general and natural statistical test. The test can distinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain threshold in the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the threshold no test can distinguish the hypotheses.\\n  The thresholds do not correspond to the presence of long-range order in the models. By aggregating information at a global scale, our test works even at very high temperatures.\\n  The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration of quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent setting; this makes it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein's method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables. Instead, we carry out an additional tensorization argument using a Markov chain that respects the symmetry of the Hamming sphere.\\n        \",\n",

Concretely, we show that $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs approximate the $k$th order moments of the Curie-Weiss model to within average error $k/\\\\sqrt{d}$ (averaged over the size $k$ subsets).

Each user may be recommended a given item at most once. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. All users of a given type have identical preferences for the items, and similarly, items of a given type are either all liked or all disliked by a given user. We assume that the matrix encoding the preferences of each user type for each item type is randomly generated; in this way, the model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, the amount of structure depending on the number of each of the types. The measure of performance of the recommendation system is the expected number of disliked recommendations per user, defined as expected regret. We propose two algorithms inspired by user-user and item-item collaborative filtering (CF), modified to explicitly make exploratory recommendations, and prove performance guarantees in terms of their expected regret. For two regimes of model parameters, with structure only in item space or only in user space, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds on regret that match our upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis elucidates system operating regimes in which existing CF algorithms are nearly optimal.\\n        \",\n",

The prediction task considered in this paper is that of predicting the values of a subset of variables given values of some other subset of variables. Virtually all previous work on graphical model learning has focused on recovering the true underlying graph. We define a distance (\"small set TV\" or ssTV) between distributions $P$ and $Q$ by taking the maximum, over all subsets $\\\\mathcal{S}$ of a given size, of the total variation between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on $\\\\mathcal{S}$; this distance captures the accuracy of the prediction task of interest. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the number of samples needed to get a distribution (from the same class) with small ssTV relative to the one generating the samples. One of the main messages of this paper is that far fewer samples are needed than for recovering the underlying tree, which means that accurate predictions are possible using the wrong tree.\\n        ',\n",

The goal is to minimize regret, or equivalently to maximize the number of +1 entries revealed at any time.

We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $Œ©(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree $d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models.\\n  Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree, hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models that have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient learning in time $O(p^2)$. We provide an algorithm whose performance interpolates between $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^{d+2})$ depending on the strength of the repulsion.\\n        ',\n",

We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each of $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\\\\log(km)$ initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the other to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).\\n        ',\n",

Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$ nodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node.\\n  In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models.

This number provides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\\\\em any} assembly algorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read process, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomena in the asymptotic limit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold, reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise in the read process on the performance.\\n        ',\n",

We establish that in the high temperature regime the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is $Œò(n^2 \\\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph; in contrast, we show that in the low temperature regime the mixing is exponentially slow for any local Markov chain. Our results, moreover, give a rigorous basis for criticisms made of such models. In the high temperature regime, where sampling with MCMC is possible, we show that any finite collection of edges are asymptotically independent; thus, the model does not possess the desired reciprocity property, and is not appreciably different from the Erd≈ës-R√©nyi random graph.\\n        ',\n",

A natural goal is to apply this approach to the Gaussian interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. We make progress towards this goal by finding the capacity region of the many-to-one and one-to-many Gaussian interference channels to within a constant number of bits. The result makes use of a deterministic model to provide insight into the Gaussian channel. The deterministic model makes explicit the dimension of signal scale. A central theme emerges: the use of lattice codes for alignment of interfering signals on the signal scale.\\n        ',\n",

The main result is that the deterministic channel uniformly approximates the Gaussian channel, the capacity regions differing by a universal constant. The problem of finding the capacity of the Gaussian channel to within a constant error is therefore reduced to that of finding the capacity of the far simpler deterministic channel. Thus, the paper provides an alternative derivation of the recent constant gap capacity characterization of Etkin, Tse, and Wang.

Much recent interest has been devoted to the reconstruction of the dependency structure from independent samples from the Markov random fields.

We show that under mild non-degeneracy conditions it reconstructs the generating graph with high probability using $Œò(d Œµ^{-2}Œ¥^{-4} \\\\log n)$ samples where $Œµ,Œ¥$ depend on the local interactions. For most local interaction $\\\\eps,Œ¥$ are of order $\\\\exp(-O(d))$.\\n Our results are optimal as a function of $n$ up to a multiplicative constant depending on $d$ and the strength of the local interactions.

Furthermore, we provide explicit $O(n^{d+2} Œµ^{-2}Œ¥^{-4}  \\\\log n)$ running time bound. In cases where the measure on the graph has correlation decay, the running time is $O(n^2 \\\\log n)$ for all fixed $d$. We also discuss the effect of observing noisy samples and show that as long as the noise level is low, our algorithm is effective. On the other hand, we construct an example where large noise implies non-identifiability even for generic noise and interactions. Finally, we briefly show that in some simple cases, models with hidden nodes can also be recovered.\\n        ',\n",

Cross-validation (CV) is widely used for hyperparameter tuning in these models, but do practical optimization methods minimize the true out-of-sample loss? A recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss. In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm, covariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a complex dependence on the few that remain. We empirically confirm our theory using simulated experiments.\\n        ',\n",

While standard practice is to model regression parameters (effects) as (1) exchangeable across datasets and (2) correlated to differing degrees across covariates, we show that this approach exhibits poor statistical performance when the number of covariates exceeds the number of datasets. For instance, in statistical genetics, we might regress dozens of traits (defining datasets) for thousands of individuals (responses) on up to millions of genetic variants (covariates). When an analyst has more covariates than datasets, we argue that it is often more natural to instead model effects as (1) exchangeable across covariates and (2) correlated to differing degrees across datasets. To this end, we propose a hierarchical model expressing our alternative perspective. We devise an empirical Bayes estimator for learning the degree of correlation between datasets. We develop theory that demonstrates that our method outperforms the classic approach when the number of covariates dominates the number of datasets, and corroborate this result empirically on several high-dimensional multiple regression and classification problems.\\n        ',\n",

Moreover, these choices can have a substantial effect on posterior inferences. Thus, considerations of robustness need to go hand in hand with nonparametric modeling. In the current paper, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the fact that variational Bayesian methods, in addition to having computational advantages in fitting complex nonparametric models, also yield sensitivities with respect to parametric and nonparametric aspects of Bayesian models. In particular, we demonstrate how to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of concentration parameter and stick-breaking distribution for inferences under Dirichlet process mixtures and related mixture models.

A recent work brought out the upside and the downside of the popular stable-Beta process prior, and generalizations thereof, in Bayesian nonparametric inference for the unseen-features problem: i) the downside lies in the limited use of the sampling information in the posterior distributions, which depend on the observable sample only through the sample size; ii) the upside lies in the analytical tractability and interpretability of the posterior distributions, which are simple Poisson distributions whose parameters are simple to compute, and depend on the sample size and the prior's parameter. In this paper, we introduce and investigate an alternative nonparametric prior, referred to as the stable-Beta scaled process prior, which is the first prior that allows to enrich the posterior distribution of the number of unseen features, through the inclusion of the sampling information on the number of distinct features in the observable sample, while maintaining the same analytical tractability and interpretability as the stable-Beta process prior. Our prior leads to a negative Binomial posterior distribution, whose parameters depends on the sample size, the observed number of distinct features and the prior's parameter, providing estimates that are simple, linear in the sampling information and computationally efficient. We apply our approach to synthetic and real genetic data, showing that it outperforms parametric and nonparametric competitors in terms of estimation accuracy.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        Many scientific problems require identifying a small set of covariates that are associated with a target response and estimating their effects. Often, these effects are nonlinear and include interactions, so linear and additive methods can lead to poor estimation and variable selection. Unfortunately, methods that simultaneously express sparsity, nonlinearity, and interactions are computationally intractable -- with runtime at least quadratic in the number of covariates, and often worse. In the present work, we solve this computational bottleneck. We show that suitable interaction models have a kernel representation, namely there exists a \"kernel trick\" to perform variable selection and estimation in $O$(# covariates) time. Our resulting fit corresponds to a sparse orthogonal decomposition of the regression function in a Hilbert space (i.e., a functional ANOVA decomposition), where interaction effects represent all variation that cannot be explained by lower-order effects. On a variety of synthetic and real datasets, our approach outperforms existing methods used for large, high-dimensional datasets while remaining competitive (or being orders of magnitude faster) in runtime.\\n        ',\n",

But the choice of GP kernel is often somewhat arbitrary. In particular, uncountably many kernels typically align with qualitative prior knowledge (e.g. function smoothness or stationarity). But in practice, data analysts choose among a handful of convenient standard kernels (e.g. squared exponential). In the present work, we ask: Would decisions made with a GP differ under other, qualitatively interchangeable kernels? We show how to formulate this sensitivity analysis as a constrained optimization problem over a finite-dimensional space. We can then use standard optimizers to identify substantive changes in relevant decisions made with a GP. We demonstrate in both synthetic and real-world examples that decisions made with a GP can exhibit substantial sensitivity to kernel choice, even when prior draws are qualitatively interchangeable to a user.\\n        ',\n",

However, these approaches depend crucially on chains meeting after a small number of transitions. For models that assign data into groups, e.g. mixture models, the obvious approaches to couple Gibbs samplers fail to meet quickly. This failure owes to the so-called \"label-switching\" problem; semantically equivalent relabelings of the groups contribute well-separated posterior modes that impede fast mixing and cause large meeting times. We here demonstrate how to avoid label switching by considering chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than labelings. Using a metric on this space, we employ an optimal transport coupling of the Gibbs conditionals. This coupling outperforms alternative couplings that rely on labelings and, on a real dataset, provides estimates more precise than usual ergodic averages in the limited time regime.

Consequently, applied statisticians frequently face a difficult decision: retain a parameter estimate from a familiar method or replace it with an estimate from a newer or complex one. While it is traditional to compare estimators using risk, such comparisons are rarely conclusive in realistic settings. In response, we propose the \"c-value\" as a measure of confidence that a new estimate achieves smaller loss than an old estimate on a given dataset. We show that it is unlikely that a computed c-value is large and that the new estimate has larger loss than the old. Therefore, just as a small p-value provides evidence to reject a null hypothesis, a large c-value provides evidence to use a new estimate in place of the old. For a wide class of problems and estimators, we show how to compute a c-value by first constructing a data-dependent high-probability lower bound on the difference in loss. The c-value is frequentist in nature, but we show that it can provide a validation of Bayesian estimates in real data applications involving hierarchical models and Gaussian processes.\\n        ',\n",

Our metric, the \"Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation,\" is automatically computable for common methods including (but not limited to) OLS, IV, MLE, GMM, and variational Bayes. We provide finite-sample error bounds on approximation performance. At minimal extra cost, we provide an exact finite-sample lower bound on sensitivity. We find that sensitivity is driven by a signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard errors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not due to misspecification. While some empirical applications are robust, results of several economics papers can be overturned by removing less than 1% of the sample.\\n        ',\n",

However, managing the infinite dimensionality of CRMs typically requires practitioners to derive ad-hoc algorithms, preventing the use of general-purpose inference methods and often leading to long compute times. We propose a general but explicit recipe to construct a simple finite-dimensional approximation that can replace the infinite-dimensional CRMs. Our independent finite approximation (IFA) is a generalization of important cases that are used in practice. The independence of atom weights in our approximation (i) makes the construction well-suited for parallel and distributed computation and (ii) facilitates more convenient inference schemes. We quantify the approximation error between IFAs and the target nonparametric prior. We compare IFAs with an alternative approximation scheme -- truncated finite approximations (TFAs), where the atom weights are constructed sequentially. We prove that, for worst-case choices of observation likelihoods, TFAs are a more efficient approximation than IFAs. However, in real-data experiments with image denoising and topic modeling, we find that IFAs perform very similarly to TFAs in terms of task-specific accuracy metrics.\\n        ',\n",

In this setting, cross-validation (CV) serves as an important tool for model assessment. Recent advances in approximate cross validation (ACV) provide accurate approximations to CV with only a single model fit, avoiding traditional CV's requirement for repeated runs of expensive algorithms. Unfortunately, these ACV methods can lose both speed and accuracy in high dimensions -- unless sparsity structure is present in the data. Fortunately, there is an alternative type of simplifying structure that is present in most data: approximate low rank (ALR). Guided by this observation, we develop a new algorithm for ACV that is fast and accurate in the presence of ALR data. Our first key insight is that the Hessian matrix -- whose inverse forms the computational bottleneck of existing ACV methods -- is ALR. We show that, despite our use of the \\\\emph{inverse} Hessian, a low-rank approximation using the largest (rather than the smallest) matrix eigenvalues enables fast, reliable ACV. Our second key insight is that, in the presence of ALR data, error in existing ACV methods roughly grows with the (approximate, low) rank rather than with the (full, high) dimension. These insights allow us to prove theoretical guarantees on the quality of our proposed algorithm -- along with fast-to-compute upper bounds on its error.

Past work has shown the resulting FMM component-count posterior is consistent; that is, the posterior concentrates on the true, generating number of components. But consistency requires the assumption that the component likelihoods are perfectly specified, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we add rigor to data-analysis folk wisdom by proving that under even the slightest model misspecification, the FMM component-count posterior diverges: the posterior probability of any particular finite number of components converges to 0 in the limit of infinite data. Contrary to intuition, posterior-density consistency is not sufficient to establish this result. We develop novel sufficient conditions that are more realistic and easily checkable than those common in the asymptotics literature.

A gold standard evaluation technique is structured cross-validation (CV), which leaves out some data subset (such as data within a time interval or data in a geographic region) in each fold. But CV here can be prohibitively slow due to the need to re-run already-expensive learning algorithms many times. Previous work has shown approximate cross-validation (ACV) methods provide a fast and provably accurate alternative in the setting of empirical risk minimization. But this existing ACV work is restricted to simpler models by the assumptions that (i) data across CV folds are independent and (ii) an exact initial model fit is available. In structured data analyses, both these assumptions are often untrue. In the present work, we address (i) by extending ACV to CV schemes with dependence structure between the folds. To address (ii), we verify -- both theoretically and empirically -- that ACV quality deteriorates smoothly with noise in the initial fit.

Under a fixed budget, then, scientists face a natural trade-off between quantity and quality; they can spend resources to sequence a greater number of genomes (quantity) or spend resources to sequence genomes with increased accuracy (quality). Our goal is to find the optimal allocation of resources between quantity and quality. Optimizing resource allocation promises to reveal as many new variations in the genome as possible, and thus as many new scientific insights as possible. In this paper, we consider the common setting where scientists have already conducted a pilot study to reveal variants in a genome and are contemplating a follow-up study. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric methodology to predict the number of new variants in the follow-up study based on the pilot study. When experimental conditions are kept constant between the pilot and follow-up, we demonstrate on real data from the gnomAD project that our prediction is more accurate than three recent proposals, and competitive with a more classic proposal. Unlike existing methods, though, our method allows practitioners to change experimental conditions between the pilot and the follow-up. We demonstrate how this distinction allows our method to be used for (i) more realistic predictions and (ii) optimal allocation of a fixed budget between quality and quantity.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we provide rigorous bounds on the error of posterior mean and uncertainty estimates that arise from full-distribution approximations, as in variational inference. Our bounds are widely applicable, as they require only that the approximating and exact posteriors have polynomial moments. Our bounds are also computationally efficient for variational inference because they require only standard values from variational objectives, straightforward analytic calculations, and simple Monte Carlo estimates. We show that our analysis naturally leads to a new and improved workflow for validated variational inference.

For sufficiently regular optimization problems the optimum depends smoothly on the data weights, and so the process of repeatedly re-fitting can be approximated with a Taylor series that can be often evaluated relatively quickly. The first-order approximation is known as the \"infinitesimal jackknife\" in the statistics literature and has been the subject of recent interest in machine learning for approximate CV. In this work, we consider high-order approximations, which we call the \"higher-order infinitesimal jackknife\" (HOIJ). Under mild regularity conditions, we provide a simple recursive procedure to compute approximations of all orders with finite-sample accuracy bounds. Additionally, we show that the HOIJ can be efficiently computed even in high dimensions using forward-mode automatic differentiation. We show that a linear approximation with bootstrap weights approximation is equivalent to those provided by asymptotic normal approximations. Consequently, the HOIJ opens up the possibility of enjoying higher-order accuracy properties of the bootstrap using local approximations. Consistency of the HOIJ for leave-one-out CV under different asymptotic regimes follows as corollaries from our finite-sample bounds under additional regularity assumptions.

In practice, however, this assumption is too strong an idealization; the distribution typically fails to be exactly invariant to permutations and de Finetti's representation theory does not apply. Thus there is the need for a distributional assumption that is both weak enough to hold in practice, and strong enough to guarantee a useful underlying representation. We introduce a relaxed notion of local exchangeability -- where swapping data associated with nearby covariates causes a bounded change in the distribution. We prove that locally exchangeable processes correspond to independent observations from an underlying measure-valued stochastic process. We thereby show that de Finetti's theorem is robust to perturbation and provide further justification for the Bayesian modelling approach. Using this probabilistic result, we develop three novel statistical procedures for (1) estimating the underlying process via local empirical measures, (2) testing via local randomization, and (3) estimating the canonical premetric of local exchangeability. These three procedures extend the applicability of previous exchangeability-based methods without sacrificing rigorous statistical guarantees.

Previous work has shown that approximations to LOOCV can be both fast and accurate -- when the unknown parameter is of small, fixed dimension. But these approximations incur a running time roughly cubic in dimension -- and we show that, besides computational issues, their accuracy dramatically deteriorates in high dimensions. Authors have suggested many potential and seemingly intuitive solutions, but these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated or compared. We find that all but one perform so poorly as to be unusable for approximating LOOCV. Crucially, though, we are able to show, both empirically and theoretically, that one approximation can perform well in high dimensions -- in cases where the high-dimensional parameter exhibits sparsity. Under interpretable assumptions, our theory demonstrates that the problem can be reduced to working within an empirically recovered (small) support.

Unfortunately, existing methods for Bayesian inference in GLMs require running times roughly cubic in parameter dimension, and so are limited to settings with at most tens of thousand parameters. We propose to reduce time and memory costs with a low-rank approximation of the data in an approach we call LR-GLM. When used with the Laplace approximation or Markov chain Monte Carlo, LR-GLM provides a full Bayesian posterior approximation and admits running times reduced by a full factor of the parameter dimension.

Our key insight is that many hierarchical models of practical interest admit a particular Gaussian process (GP) representation; the GP allows us to capture the posterior with a vector of O(p) kernel hyper-parameters rather than O(p^2) interactions and main effects. With the implicit representation, we can run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) over model hyper-parameters in time and memory linear in p per iteration.

Here, we develop a full generative model for probabilistically reconstructing trees of cellular differentiation from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, we extend the framework of the classical Dirichlet diffusion tree to simultaneously infer branch topology and latent cell states along continuous trajectories over the full tree. In tandem, we construct a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that interleaves Metropolis-Hastings and message passing to leverage model structure for efficient inference. Finally, we demonstrate that these techniques can recover latent trajectories from simulated single-cell transcriptomes.

Our strategy is to control the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the Wasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike computing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized posterior distribution, the Fisher distance is tractable to compute because it requires access only to the gradient of the log posterior density.

We show that unlike the Kullback--Leibler divergence (used in variational inference), the pF divergence bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance, which in turn provides tight bounds the pointwise difference of the mean and variance functions. We demonstrate that, for sparse GP likelihood approximations, we can minimize the pF divergence efficiently.

       " '\\n        Learning a Bayesian network (BN) from data can be useful for decision-making or discovering causal relationships. However, traditional methods often fail in modern applications, which exhibit a larger number of observed variables than data points. The resulting uncertainty about the underlying network as well as the desire to incorporate prior information recommend a Bayesian approach to learning the BN, but the highly combinatorial structure of BNs poses a striking challenge for inference. The current state-of-the-art methods such as order MCMC are faster than previous methods but prevent the use of many natural structural priors and still have running time exponential in the maximum indegree of the true directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the BN. We here propose an alternative posterior approximation based on the observation that, if we incorporate empirical conditional independence tests, we can focus on a high-probability DAG associated with each order of the vertices. We show that our method allows the desired flexibility in prior specification, removes timing dependence on the maximum indegree and yields provably good posterior approximations; in addition, we show that it achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and sampler mixing on several datasets.\\n        ',\n",

But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often sacrifice accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of scalability. This work shows that previous Bayesian coreset construction algorithms---which build a small, weighted subset of the data that approximates the full dataset---are no exception. We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with validation of GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous coreset constructions.\\n        ',\n",

Often used as a preliminary step for dimensionality reduction or to facilitate interpretation, finding robust and stable clusters is often crucial for appropriate for downstream analysis. In the present work, we consider Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, a particularly popular set of Bayesian models for clustering due to their flexibility. Because of its complexity, the Bayesian posterior often cannot be computed exactly, and approximations must be employed. Mean-field variational Bayes forms a posterior approximation by solving an optimization problem and is widely used due to its speed. An exact BNP posterior might vary dramatically when presented with different data. As such, stability and robustness of the clustering should be assessed.\\n  A popular mean to assess stability is to apply the bootstrap by resampling the data, and rerun the clustering for each simulated data set. The time cost is thus often very expensive, especially for the sort of exploratory analysis where clustering is typically used. We propose to use a fast and automatic approximation to the full bootstrap called the \"linear bootstrap\", which can be seen by local data perturbation. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply this idea to a data analysis pipeline, consisting of an MFVB approximation to a BNP clustering posterior of time course gene expression data. We show that using auto-differentiation tools, the necessary calculations can be done automatically, and that the linear bootstrap is a fast but approximate alternative to the bootstrap.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        The automation of posterior inference in Bayesian data analysis has enabled experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility. However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern datasets, and modifications to make them so are typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic datasets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.\\n        ',\n",

Probabilistic approaches, particularly Bayesian ones, allow coherent estimates of uncertainty, incorporation of prior information, and sharing of power across experiments via hierarchical models. In practice, however, the approximate Bayesian methods necessary for inference have either failed to scale to large data sets or failed to provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of inference. We propose a new approach based on constructing polynomial approximate sufficient statistics for GLMs (PASS-GLM). We demonstrate that our method admits a simple algorithm as well as trivial streaming and distributed extensions that do not compound error across computations. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of point (MAP) estimates, the approximate posterior, and posterior mean and uncertainty estimates. We validate our approach empirically in the case of logistic regression using a quadratic approximation and show competitive performance with stochastic gradient descent, MCMC, and the Laplace approximation in terms of speed and multiple measures of accuracy -- including on an advertising data set with 40 million data points and 20,000 covariates.\\n        ',\n",

However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances. Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude faster than MCMC.\\n        ',\n",

However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        In Bayesian analysis, the posterior follows from the data and a choice of a prior and a likelihood. One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable variation in the choice of prior, since this choice is made by the modeler and is often somewhat subjective. A different, equally subjectively plausible choice of prior may result in a substantially different posterior, and so different conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our conclusions would not be robust to the choice of prior. To determine whether our model is robust, we must quantify how sensitive our posterior is to perturbations of our prior. Despite the importance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, generic, easy-to-use methods to quantify Bayesian robustness are still lacking.\\n  Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate that powerful measures of robustness can be easily calculated from Variational Bayes (VB) approximate posteriors. We begin with local robustness, which measures the effect of infinitesimal changes to the prior on a posterior mean of interest. In particular, we show that the influence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed form expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness measures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one prior entirely with another. We propose a simple approximate non-local robustness measure and demonstrate its effectiveness on a simulated data set.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Variational inference (VI) provides fast approximations of a Bayesian posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.\\n        ',\n",

Often the data are also exchangeable, i.e., their joint distribution is invariant to reordering. In clustering---a special case of trait allocation---exchangeability implies the existence of both a de Finetti representation and an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF), distributional representations useful for computational and theoretical purposes. In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture single-occurrence \"dust\" groups. We further introduce a novel constrained version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait allocations. As an application of our general theory, we characterize the distribution of all edge-exchangeable graphs, a class of recently-developed models that captures realistic sparse graph sequences.\\n        ',\n",

Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.\\n        ',\n",

Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size, it is necessary to develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of networks. One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree distribution. However, other types of power laws that have been observed empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data. In this paper, we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of interest for modeling graph data, including sparsity and several types of power laws. We outline a general framework for graph generative models using completely random measures; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), we consider instantiating more of the existing atoms of the random measure as the dataset size increases rather than adding new atoms to the measure. We see that these two models can be complementary; they respectively yield interpretations as (1) time passing among existing members of a network and (2) new individuals joining a network. We detail a particular instance of this framework and show simulated results that suggest this model exhibits some desirable asymptotic power-law behavior.\\n        ',\n",

We define a notion of edge exchangeability for random graphs in contrast to the established notion of infinite exchangeability for random graphs --- which has traditionally relied on exchangeability of nodes (rather than edges) in a graph. We show that, unlike node exchangeability, edge exchangeability encompasses models that are known to provide a projective sequence of random graphs that circumvent the Aldous-Hoover Theorem and exhibit sparsity, i.e., sub-quadratic growth of the number of edges with the number of nodes. We show how edge-exchangeability of graphs relates naturally to existing notions of exchangeability from clustering (a.k.a. partitions) and other familiar combinatorial structures.\\n        ',\n",

These two classes and their constituent representations subsume existing ones that have previously been developed in an ad hoc manner for specific processes. Since a complete infinite-dimensional CRM cannot be used explicitly for computation, sequential representations are often truncated for tractability. We provide truncation error analyses for each type of sequential representation, as well as their normalized versions, thereby generalizing and improving upon existing truncation error bounds in the literature. We analyze the computational complexity of the sequential representations, which in conjunction with our error bounds allows us to directly compare representations and discuss their relative efficiency. We include numerous applications of our theoretical results to commonly-used (normalized) CRMs, demonstrating that our results enable a straightforward representation and analysis of CRMs that has not previously been available in a Bayesian nonparametric context.\\n        ',\n",

Despite the fundamental importance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, the tools of robust Bayes are not commonly used in practice. This is in large part due to the difficulty of calculating robustness measures from MCMC draws. Although methods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack generality and often require additional coding or computation.\\n  In contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable to robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect to a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior or likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem, its methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior quantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In the present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field variational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular factorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation. We start by outlining existing local prior measures of robustness. Next, we use these results to derive closed-form measures of the sensitivity of mean-field variational posterior approximation to prior specification.

Although this approach has gained widespread adoption, its utilization can significantly overestimate D due to the non-linear recombination processes that artificially broaden the carrier distribution profile. Here, we simulate diffusive processes in both excitonic and free carrier semiconductors and present revised MSD Models that take into account second-order (i.e. bimolecular) and third-order (i.e. Auger) processes to accurately recover D for various types of materials. For perovskite thin films, utilization of these models can reduce fitting error by orders of magnitude, especially for commonly deployed excitation conditions where carrier densities are > 5x10$^1$$^6$ cm$^-$$^3$. In addition, we show that commonly-deployed MSD Models are not well-suited for the study of films with microstructure, especially when boundary behavior is unknown and feature sizes are comparable to the diffusion length.

Earlier studies of quasi-DC electric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the electrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric fields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In contrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with high-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few picoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD luminescence even in the absence of an external charge source. Our experiments show that QD luminescence is associated with a remarkably high and rapid modulation of the QD band-gap, which is changing by more than 0.5 eV (corresponding to 25% of the unperturbed bandgap energy) within the picosecond timeframe of THz field profile. We show that these colossal energy shifts can be consistently explained by the quantum confined Stark effect. Our work demonstrates a route to extreme modulation of material properties without configurational changes in material sets or geometries. Additionally, we expect that this platform can be adapted to a novel compact THz detection scheme where conversion of THz fields (with meV-scale photon energies) to the visible/near-IR band (with eV-scale photon energies) can be achieved at room temperature with high bandwidth and sensitivity.\\n        ',\n",

We consider plexcitons emerging from the interaction of excitons in an organic molecular layer with surface plasmons in a metallic film. We predict the emergence of Dirac cones in the two-dimensional bandstructure of plexcitons due to the inherent alignment of the excitonic transitions in the organic layer. These Dirac cones may open up in energy by simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting energy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which travel at the interface of this plexcitonic system. Our theoretical proposal suggests that plexcitons are a convenient and simple platform for the exploration of exotic phases of matter as well as of novel ways to direct energy flow at the nanoscale.\\n        ',\n",

These languages provide programming constructs and tools for probabilistic modeling and automated inference. Prior work introduced a probabilistic programming language, ProbZelus, to extend probabilistic programming functionality to unbounded streams of data. This work demonstrated that the delayed sampling inference algorithm could be extended to work in a streaming context. ProbZelus showed that while delayed sampling could be effectively deployed on some programs, depending on the probabilistic model under consideration, delayed sampling is not guaranteed to use a bounded amount of memory over the course of the execution of the program.\\n  In this paper, we the present conditions on a probabilistic program's execution under which delayed sampling will execute in bounded memory. The two conditions are dataflow properties of the core operations of delayed sampling: the $m$-consumed property and the unseparated paths property. A program executes in bounded memory under delayed sampling if, and only if, it satisfies the $m$-consumed and unseparated paths properties. We propose a static analysis that abstracts over these properties to soundly ensure that any program that passes the analysis satisfies these properties, and thus executes in bounded memory under delayed sampling.\\n        \",\n",

From a shared ResNet-20 initialization, we train several network copies (\\\\emph{siblings}) to completion using different SGD data orders on CIFAR-10. While the siblings' pruning masks are naively not much more similar than chance, starting sibling training after a few epochs of shared pretraining significantly increases pruning overlap. We then choose a subnetwork by either (1) taking all weights that survive pruning in any sibling (mask union), or (2) taking only the weights that survive pruning across all siblings (mask intersection). The resulting subnetwork is retrained. Strikingly, we find that union and intersection masks perform very similarly. Both methods match the accuracy-sparsity tradeoffs of the one-shot magnitude pruning baseline, even when we combine masks from up to $k = 10$ siblings.\\n        \",\n",

A partially observable environment is an environment whose state is not completely visible to the program, but from which the program receives partial observations.

In safety-critical domains, to formally verify safety properties developers may write an environment model. The model captures the relationship between observations and hidden states and is used to prove the software correct.\\n  In this paper, we present a new methodology for writing and verifying programs in partially observable environments. We present belief programming, a programming methodology where developers write an environment model that the program runtime automatically uses to perform state estimation. A belief program dynamically updates and queries a belief state that captures the possible states the environment could be in. To enable verification, we present Epistemic Hoare Logic that reasons about the possible belief states of a belief program the same way that classical Hoare logic reasons about the possible states of a program. We develop these concepts by defining a semantics and a program logic for a simple core language called BLIMP. In a case study, we show how belief programming could be used to write and verify a controller for the Mars Polar Lander in BLIMP. We present an implementation of BLIMP called CBLIMP and evaluate it to determine the feasibility of belief programming.\\n        ',\n",

We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its downstream transferability?\\n  In this paper, we examine supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch yet still reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH and question whether matching subnetworks still exist in pre-trained computer vision models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR, and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities. We conclude that the core LTH observations remain generally relevant in the pre-training paradigm of computer vision, but more delicate discussions are needed in some cases.

This complexity arises from the expertise required to design benchmarks and measurement frameworks that can precisely measure the values of parameters at such fine granularity. In some cases, these parameters do not necessarily have a physical realization and are therefore fundamentally approximate, or even unmeasurable.\\n  In this paper we present DiffTune, a system for learning the parameters of x86 basic block CPU simulators from coarse-grained end-to-end measurements. Given a simulator, DiffTune learns its parameters by first replacing the original simulator with a differentiable surrogate, another function that approximates the original function; by making the surrogate differentiable, DiffTune is then able to apply gradient-based optimization techniques even when the original function is non-differentiable, such as is the case with CPU simulators. With this differentiable surrogate, DiffTune then applies gradient-based optimization to produce values of the simulator's parameters that minimize the simulator's error on a dataset of ground truth end-to-end performance measurements. Finally, the learned parameters are plugged back into the original simulator.\\n  DiffTune is able to automatically learn the entire set of microarchitecture-specific parameters within the Intel x86 simulation model of llvm-mca, a basic block CPU simulator based on LLVM's instruction scheduling model.

Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning, they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training, randomly shuffling the weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values preserves or improves accuracy. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property suggests broader challenges with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization, or both.\\n        ',\n",

In this work, we combine these observations to assess whether such trainable, transferrable subnetworks exist in pre-trained BERT models. For a range of downstream tasks, we indeed find matching subnetworks at 40% to 90% sparsity. We find these subnetworks at (pre-trained) initialization, a deviation from prior NLP research where they emerge only after some amount of training. Subnetworks found on the masked language modeling task (the same task used to pre-train the model) transfer universally; those found on other tasks transfer in a limited fashion if at all.

Therefore an optimizing compiler can identify the computation shared between multiple components and generate code that computes the shared computation only once.\\n  These techniques, however, do not support reductions that -- when phrased in the language of the polyhedral model -- span multiple dependent statements.

Together, these features enable $Œª_S$ to expose differentiable, higher-order functions for integration, optimization, and root-finding as first-class functions with automatically computed derivatives. $Œª_S$'s semantics is computable, meaning that values can be computed to arbitrary precision, and we implement $Œª_S$ as an embedded language in Haskell.\\n  We use $Œª_S$ to construct novel differentiable libraries for representing probability distributions, implicit surfaces, and generalized parametric surfaces -- all as instances of higher-order datatypes -- and present case studies that rely on computing the derivatives of these higher-order functions and datatypes.

In this paper, we compare fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training schedule. Learning rate rewinding (which we propose) trains the unpruned weights from their final values using the same learning rate schedule as weight rewinding.

Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise.

An important milestone in this transition has been the release of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard that specifies interoperable wireless physical and medium access control layers targeted to sensor node radios. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of an 802.15.4 radio for use in an ultra low power sensor node operating in a dense network. Starting from measurements carried out on the off-the-shelf radio, effective radio activation and link adaptation policies are derived. It is shown that, in a typical sensor network scenario, the average power per node can be reduced down to 211m mm mW. Next, the energy consumption breakdown between the different phases of a packet transmission is presented, indicating which part of the transceiver architecture can most effectively be optimized in order to further reduce the radio power, enabling self-powered wireless microsensor networks.\\n        ',\n",

In these systems, it is impossible to compute (total and deterministic) discrete decisions based on connected spaces such as $\\\\mathbb{R}$. We present programming-language semantics based on constructive topology with variants allowing nondeterminism and/or partiality.

We then introduce pattern matching on spaces, a language construct for creating programs on spaces, generalizing pattern matching in functional programming, where patterns need not represent decidable predicates and also may overlap or be inexhaustive, giving rise to nondeterminism or partiality, respectively. Nondeterminism and/or partiality also yield formal logics for constructing approximate decision procedures.

Most past parser-combinator approaches cannot handle these formats, and the few exceptions require redundancy -- one part of the natural grammar needs to be hand-translated into hints in multiple parts of a parser program. We show how to recover very natural and nonredundant format specifications, covering all popular network packet formats and generating both decoders and encoders automatically. The catch is that we use the Coq proof assistant to derive both kinds of artifacts using tactics, automatically, in a way that guarantees that they form inverses of each other.

We use high-performance classical tools to construct, optimize, and simulate quantum circuits subject to realistic error models in order to empirically determine the \"simulation capacity\" of near-term simulation experiments implemented via quantum signal processing (QSP), describing the relationship between simulation time, system size, and resolution of QSP circuits which are optimally configured to balance algorithmic precision and external noise. From simulation capacity models, we estimate maximum tolerable error rate for meaningful simulation experiments on a near-term quantum computer.\\n  By exploiting symmetry inherent to the QSP circuit, we further demonstrate that its capacity for quantum simulation can be increased by at least two orders of magnitude if errors are systematic and unitary.

Methods for obtaining effective pure input states by a series of manipulations have been described by Gershenfeld and Chuang (logical labeling) and Cory et al. (spatial averaging) for the case of quantum computation with nuclear magnetic resonance. We give a different technique called temporal averaging. This method is based on classical randomization, requires no ancilla qubits and can be implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance without using gradient fields. We introduce several temporal averaging algorithms suitable for both high temperature and low temperature bulk quantum computing and analyze the signal to noise behavior of each.\\n        ',\n",

Each client holds a private bitstring. The servers want to recover the set of all popular strings, without learning anything else about any client's string. A web-browser vendor, for instance, can use our protocol to figure out which homepages are popular, without learning any user's homepage. We also consider the simpler private subset-histogram problem, in which the servers want to count how many clients hold strings in a particular set without revealing this set to the clients.\\n  Our protocols use two data-collection servers and, in a protocol run, each client send sends only a single message to the servers. Our protocols protect client privacy against arbitrary misbehavior by one of the servers and our approach requires no public-key cryptography (except for secure channels), nor general-purpose multiparty computation. Instead, we rely on incremental distributed point functions, a new cryptographic tool that allows a client to succinctly secret-share the labels on the nodes of an exponentially large binary tree, provided that the tree has a single non-zero path. Along the way, we develop new general tools for providing malicious security in applications of distributed point functions.\\n  In an experimental evaluation with two servers on opposite sides of the U.S., the servers can find the 200 most popular strings among a set of 400,000 client-held 256-bit strings in 54 minutes. Our protocols are highly parallelizable.

Like existing cloud-based mobile-backup systems, including those of Apple and Google, SafetyPin requires users to remember only a short PIN and defends against brute-force PIN-guessing attacks using hardware security protections. Unlike today's systems, SafetyPin splits trust over a cluster of hardware security modules (HSMs) in order to provide security guarantees that scale with the number of HSMs. In this way, SafetyPin protects backed-up user data even against an attacker that can adaptively compromise many of the system's constituent HSMs. SafetyPin provides this protection without sacrificing scalability or fault tolerance. Decentralizing trust while respecting the resource limits of today's HSMs requires a synthesis of systems-design principles and cryptographic tools. We evaluate SafetyPin on a cluster of 100 low-cost HSMs and show that a SafetyPin-protected recovery takes 1.01 seconds.

In terms of communication, Express only incurs a constant-factor overhead per message sent regardless of the number of users, whereas previous cryptographically-secure systems Pung and Riposte had communication costs proportional to roughly the square root of the number of users. In terms of computation, Express only uses symmetric key cryptographic primitives and makes both practical and asymptotic improvements on protocols employed by prior work. These improvements enable Express to increase message throughput, reduce latency, and consume over 100x less bandwidth than Pung and Riposte, dropping the end to end cost of running a realistic whistleblowing application by 6x.\\n        ',\n",

Yet, recent experimental work demonstrates that tens of thousands of devices on the Internet use RSA and DSA secrets drawn from a small pool of candidate values. As a result, an adversary can derive the device's secret keys without breaking the underlying cryptosystem. We introduce a new threat model, under which there is a systemic solution to such randomness flaws. In our model, when a device generates a cryptographic key, it incorporates some random values from an entropy authority into its cryptographic secrets and then proves to the authority, using zero-knowledge-proof techniques, that it performed this operation correctly. By presenting an entropy-authority-signed public-key certificate to a third party (like a certificate authority or SSH client), the device can demonstrate that its public key incorporates randomness from the authority and is therefore drawn from a large pool of candidate values. Where possible, our protocol protects against eavesdroppers, entropy authority misbehavior, and devices attempting to discredit the entropy authority. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we have implemented and evaluated its performance on a commodity wireless home router.

       " '\\n        Matrix completion is the study of recovering an underlying matrix from a sparse subset of noisy observations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of \"latent confounders\", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield \"missing not at random\" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call \"synthetic nearest neighbors\" (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this also provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data. Across simulated and real data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed estimator.\\n        ',\n",

The enormous potential for distribution flexibility could meet the transmission system's needs, changing the paradigm of generator-centric energy and ancillary services provided to a demand-centric one, by placing more importance on smaller resources, such as flexible demands and electric vehicles. For unlocking such capabilities, it is essential to understand the aggregated flexibility that can be harvested from the large population of new technologies located in distribution grids. Distribution grids, therefore, could provide aggregated flexibility at the transmission level.

Such externalities couple firms' optimal allocations, despite the inherent free replicability of data. In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of externalities increases the optimal revenue of a monopolistic data seller by letting firms pay to prevent allocations to other competing firms. This is shown by first reducing the combinatorial problem of allocating and pricing multiple datasets to the auction of a single digital good. We achieve this by modeling utility for data solely through the increase in prediction accuracy it provides. Then, we find the welfare and revenue maximizing mechanisms, highlighting how the form of firms' private information - whether they know the externalities they exert on others or vice-versa - affects their overall structures. In all cases, the optimal allocation rule is a single threshold (one per firm), where either all data is allocated or none is.\\n        \",\n",

Specifically, the method targets the situation where, due to pseudo-measurement uncertainty, it is advantageous to run the state estimation solver potentially thousands of times over sampled input perturbations in order to compute probabilistic bounds on the underlying system state. This routine, termed the Accelerated Probabilistic State Estimator (APSE), efficiently searches for the solutions of sequential state estimation problems in a low dimensional subspace with a reduced order model (ROM). When a sufficiently accurate solution is not found, the APSE reverts to a conventional QR factorization-based Gauss-Newton solver. It then uses the resulting solution to preform a simple basis expansion of the low-dimensional subspace, thus improving the reduced model solver.

In this paper, we propose RADIAL-RL, a method to train reinforcement learning agents with improved robustness against any $l_p$-bounded adversarial attack. By simply minimizing an upper bound of the loss functions under worst case adversarial perturbation derived from efficient robustness verification methods, we significantly improve robustness of RL-agents trained on Atari-2600 games and show that RADIAL-RL can beat state-of-the-art robust training algorithms when evaluated against PGD-attacks. We also propose a new evaluation method, Greedy Worst-Case Reward (GWC), for measuring attack agnostic robustness of RL agents. GWC can be evaluated efficiently and it serves as a good estimate of the reward under the worst possible sequence of adversarial attacks; in particular, GWC accounts for the importance of each action and their temporal dependency, improving upon previous approaches that only evaluate whether each single action can change under input perturbations.

       " \"\\n        Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a recently introduced volumetric technique for noninvasive estimation of electrical properties (EP) from magnetic resonance measurements. Previous work evaluated GMT using ideal radiofrequency (RF) excitations. The aim of this simulation study was to assess GMT performance with a realistic RF coil. Methods: We designed a transmit-receive RF coil with $8$ decoupled channels for $7$T head imaging. We calculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for different RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct EP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable when the coil was loaded with different head models. Mean error in EP estimation changed from $7.5\\\\%$ to $9.5\\\\%$ and from $4.8\\\\%$ to $7.2\\\\%$ for relative permittivity and conductivity, respectively, when changing head model without re-tuning the coil. Results slightly improved when an SVD-based RF shimming algorithm was applied, in place of excitation with one coil at a time. Despite errors in EP, RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) and absorbed power could be predicted with less than $0.5\\\\%$ error over the entire head. GMT could accurately detect a numerically inserted tumor. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that GMT can reliably reconstruct EP in realistic simulated scenarios using a tailored 8-channel RF coil design at $7$T. Future work will focus on construction of the coil and optimization of GMT's robustness to noise, to enable in-vivo GMT experiments. Significance: GMT could provide accurate estimations of tissue EP, which could be used as biomarkers and could enable patient-specific estimation of RF power deposition, which is an unsolved problem for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging.\\n        \",\n",

The algorithm applies not only to Euclidean spaces, but also to general $\\\\ell_p$-normed finite-dimensional real vector spaces. We also discuss its stability under stochastic oracles and provide bounds on its sample complexity. Our iteration complexity and sample complexity bounds either match or improve the best known bounds for the same or less general nonconvex-nonconcave settings, such as those that satisfy variational coherence or in which a weak solution to the associated variational inequality problem is assumed to exist.\\n        ',\n",

Our guarantees hold, in fact, for the celebrated Chow-Liu [1968] algorithm, using the plug-in estimator for estimating mutual information. While this (or any other) algorithm may fail to identify the structure of the underlying model correctly from a finite sample, we show that it will still learn a tree-structured model that is $Œµ$-close to the true one in total variation distance, a guarantee called \"proper learning.\"\\n  Our guarantees do not follow from known results for the Chow-Liu algorithm and the ensuing literature on learning graphical models, including a recent renaissance of algorithms on this learning challenge, which only yield asymptotic consistency results, or sample-inefficient and/or time-inefficient algorithms, unless further assumptions are placed on the graphical model, such as bounds on the \"strengths\" of the model\\'s edges/hyperedges. While we establish guarantees for a widely known and simple algorithm, the analysis that this algorithm succeeds and is sample-optimal is quite complex, requiring a hierarchical classification of the edges into layers with different reconstruction guarantees, depending on their strength, combined with delicate uses of the subadditivity of the squared Hellinger distance over graphical models to control the error accumulation.\\n        ',\n",

This result addresses a question of Mertikopoulos & Zhou (2018), who asked whether extra-gradient approaches (such as OG) can be applied to achieve improved guarantees in the multi-agent learning setting. The proof of our upper bound uses a new technique centered around an adaptive choice of potential function at each iteration. We also show that the $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$ rate is tight for all $p$-SCLI algorithms, which includes OG as a special case.

This problem has remained a challenge since the early works of [Tobin 1958, Amemiya 1973, Hausman and Wise 1977], its applications are abundant, and its history dates back even further to the work of Galton, Pearson, Lee, and Fisher. While consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the error rates are not well-understood, especially in high dimensions.\\n  Under a thickness assumption about the covariance matrix of the covariates in the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the coefficient vector $w$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $l_2$ error $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\sqrt{k/n})$. Our estimator uses Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) without replacement on the negative log-likelihood of the truncated sample. For the statistically efficient estimation we only need oracle access to the set $S$.In order to achieve computational efficiency we need to assume that $S$ is a union of a finite number of intervals but still can be complicated. PSGD without replacement must be restricted to an appropriately defined convex cone to guarantee that the negative log-likelihood is strongly convex, which in turn is established using concentration of matrices on variables with sub-exponential tails. We perform experiments on simulated data to illustrate the accuracy of our estimator.\\n  As a corollary, we show that SGD learns the parameters of single-layer neural networks with noisy activation functions.\\n        ',\n",

Not only are there no known first-order methods converging even to approximate local min-max points, but the computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity of the problem, as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in constrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives and linear constraints.\\n  As a warm-up, we show that, even when the objective is a Lipschitz and smooth differentiable function, deciding whether a min-max point exists, in fact even deciding whether an approximate min-max point exists, is NP-hard. More importantly, we show that an approximate local min-max point of large enough approximation is guaranteed to exist, but finding one such point is PPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of Gradient Descent/Ascent.\\n  An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness result in the Nemirovsky-Yudin model. We show that, given oracle access to some function $f : P \\\\to [-1, 1]$ and its gradient $\\\\nabla f$, where $P \\\\subseteq [0, 1]^d$ is a known convex polytope, every algorithm that finds a $\\\\varepsilon$-approximate local min-max point needs to make a number of queries that is exponential in at least one of $1/\\\\varepsilon$, $L$, $G$, or $d$, where $L$ and $G$ are respectively the smoothness and Lipschitzness of $f$ and $d$ is the dimension. This comes in sharp contrast to minimization problems, where finding approximate local minima in the same setting can be done with Projected Gradient Descent using $O(L/\\\\varepsilon)$ many queries. Our result is the first to show an exponential separation between these two fundamental optimization problems.\\n        ',\n",

Particle coordinates at a single time instant, possibly noisy or truncated, are recorded in each snapshot but are unpaired across the snapshots. By training a physics-informed generative model that generates \"fake\" sample paths, we aim to fit the observed particle ensemble distributions with a curve in the probability measure space, which is induced from the inferred particle dynamics. We employ different metrics to quantify the differences between distributions, e.g., the sliced Wasserstein distances and the adversarial losses in generative adversarial networks (GANs). We refer to this method as generative \"ensemble-regression\" (GER), in analogy to the classic \"point-regression\", where we infer the dynamics by performing regression in the Euclidean space. We illustrate the GER by learning the drift and diffusion terms of particle ensembles governed by SODEs with Brownian motions and Levy processes up to 100 dimensions. We also discuss how to treat cases with noisy or truncated observations. Apart from systems consisting of independent particles, we also tackle nonlocal interacting particle systems with unknown interaction potential parameters by constructing a physics-informed loss function. Finally, we investigate scenarios of paired observations and discuss how to reduce the dimensionality in such cases by proving a convergence theorem that provides theoretical support.\\n        ',\n",

The goal is to recover $x^*$ under some favorable conditions on the $A_i$\\'s and the noise distribution. We prove that there exists a computationally and statistically efficient method for recovering $k$-sparse $n$-dimensional vectors $x^*$ from $m$ truncated samples, which attains an optimal $\\\\ell_2$ reconstruction error of $O(\\\\sqrt{(k \\\\log n)/m})$. As a corollary, our guarantees imply a computationally efficient and information-theoretically optimal algorithm for compressed sensing with truncation, which may arise from measurement saturation effects. Our result follows from a statistical and computational analysis of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for solving a natural adaptation of the LASSO optimization problem that accommodates truncation. This generalizes the works of both: (1) [Daskalakis et al. 2018], where no regularization is needed due to the low-dimensionality of the data, and (2) [Wainright 2009], where the objective function is simple due to the absence of truncation. In order to deal with both truncation and high-dimensionality at the same time, we develop new techniques that not only generalize the existing ones but we believe are of independent interest.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Generative neural networks have been empirically found very promising in providing effective structural priors for compressed sensing, since they can be trained to span low-dimensional data manifolds in high-dimensional signal spaces. Despite the non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, it has also been shown theoretically that, for neural networks with random Gaussian weights, a signal in the range of the network can be efficiently, approximately recovered from a few noisy measurements. However, a major bottleneck of these theoretical guarantees is a network expansivity condition: that each layer of the neural network must be larger than the previous by a logarithmic factor. Our main contribution is to break this strong expansivity assumption, showing that constant expansivity suffices to get efficient recovery algorithms, besides it also being information-theoretically necessary. To overcome the theoretical bottleneck in existing approaches we prove a novel uniform concentration theorem for random functions that might not be Lipschitz but satisfy a relaxed notion which we call \"pseudo-Lipschitzness.\" Using this theorem we can show that a matrix concentration inequality known as the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC), which was previously only known to hold for Gaussian matrices with logarithmic aspect ratio, in fact holds for constant aspect ratios too. Since the WDC is a fundamental matrix concentration inequality in the heart of all existing theoretical guarantees on this problem, our tighter bound immediately yields improvements in all known results in the literature on compressed sensing with deep generative priors, including one-bit recovery, phase retrieval, low-rank matrix recovery, and more.\\n        ',\n",

We propose a unified framework that smoothly interpolates between these two settings, enabling significantly richer estimation guarantees from one, a few, or many samples.\\n  Our main theorem provides guarantees for one-sample estimation, quantifying the estimation error in terms of the metric entropy of a family of interaction matrices. As corollaries of our main theorem, we derive bounds when the model's interaction matrix is a (sparse) linear combination of known matrices, or it belongs to a finite set, or to a high-dimensional manifold. In fact, our main result handles multiple independent samples by viewing them as one sample from a larger model, and can be used to derive estimation bounds that are qualitatively similar to those obtained in the afore-described multiple-sample literature. Our technical approach benefits from sparsifying a model's interaction network, conditioning on subsets of variables that make the dependencies in the resulting conditional distribution sufficiently weak. We use this sparsification technique to prove strong concentration and anti-concentration results for the Ising model, which we believe have applications beyond the scope of this paper.\\n        \",\n",

Additionally, we present strong evidence that these two approximations, enhanced by an initial automatic feature extraction through deep neural networks, outperform a broad range of state-of-the-art methods in terms of time efficiency, negative log-predictive density, and root mean squared error.\\n        ',\n",

Conventionally these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group effects. Using a {\\\\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength of the peer-group effects. The heart of our result is a novel approach for showing strong concavity of the log pseudo-likelihood of the model, implying statistical error rate of $\\\\sqrt{d/n}$ for the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE), where $d$ is the dimensionality of the covariate vectors and $n$ is the size of the network (number of nodes). Our model generalizes vanilla logistic regression as well as the peer-effect models studied in recent works, and our results extend these results to accommodate higher-order interactions.\\n        ',\n",

GANs have been widely used in sample synthesis, de-noising, domain transfer, etc. GANs, however, are designed in a model-free fashion where no additional information about the underlying distribution is available. In many applications, however, practitioners have access to the underlying independence graph of the variables, either as a Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF). We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs? In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying subadditivity properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds on the distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure of the Bayes-net or the MRF. We prove that several popular probability divergences satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions. These results lead to a principled design of a model-based GAN that uses a set of simple discriminators on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net/MRF, rather than a giant discriminator on the entire network, providing significant statistical and computational benefits. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our principled design of model-based GANs.\\n        ',\n",

This is one instance of a more general framework for designing two-part tariff auctions, adapting the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16]. Given a (not necessarily incentive compatible) auction format $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, our framework augments the auction with a personalized entry fee for each bidder, which must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of realized bids. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful $O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments; an open question in the literature [RST17].\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we show that the last iterate of EG converges at a rate of $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a convergence rate guarantee for the last iterate of EG for the smooth convex-concave saddle point problem. Moreover, we show that this rate is tight by proving a lower bound of $Œ©(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$ for the last iterate. This lower bound therefore shows a quadratic separation of the convergence rates of ergodic and last iterates in smooth convex-concave saddle point problems.\\n        ',\n",

We establish parametrized sample complexity bounds for learning an up-to-$\\\\varepsilon$ optimal mechanism in both models, which scale polynomially in the size of the model, i.e.~the number of items and bidders, and only exponential in the natural complexity measure of the model, namely either the largest in-degree (for Bayesian Networks) or the size of the largest hyper-edge (for Markov Random Fields).\\n  We obtain our learnability results through a novel and modular framework that involves first proving a robustness theorem. We show that, given only ``approximate distributions'' for bidder valuations, we can learn a mechanism whose revenue is nearly optimal simultaneously for all ``true distributions'' that are close to the ones we were given in Prokhorov distance. Thus, to learn a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg. When item values are sampled from more general graphical models, we combine our robustness theorem with novel sample complexity results for learning Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks in Prokhorov distance, which may be of independent interest. Finally, in the single-item case, our robustness result can be strengthened to hold under an even weaker distribution distance, the L√©vy distance.\\n        \",\n",

This work has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is motivated by settings where data is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the standard Dobrushin's condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d. analogs, and our learnability bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.\\n        \",\n",

The assumption that the response variables are independent is, however, too strong. In many applications, these responses are collected on nodes of a network, or some spatial or temporal domain, and are dependent. Examples abound in financial and meteorological applications, and dependencies naturally arise in social networks through peer effects. Regression with dependent responses has thus received a lot of attention in the Statistics and Economics literature, but there are no strong consistency results unless multiple independent samples of the vectors of dependent responses can be collected from these models. We present computationally and statistically efficient methods for linear and logistic regression models when the response variables are dependent on a network. Given one sample from a networked linear or logistic regression model and under mild assumptions, we prove strong consistency results for recovering the vector of coefficients and the strength of the dependencies, recovering the rates of standard regression under independent observations.

Under the same condition, we show that the synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous Gibbs samplers can be coupled so that the expected Hamming distance between their (multivariate) samples remains bounded by $O(œÑ\\\\log n),$ where $n$ is the number of variables in the graphical model, and $œÑ$ is a measure of the asynchronicity. A similar bound holds for any constant power of the Hamming distance. Hence, the expectation of any function that is Lipschitz with respect to a power of the Hamming distance, can be estimated with a bias that grows logarithmically in $n$. Going beyond Lipschitz functions, we consider the bias arising from asynchronicity in estimating the expectation of polynomial functions of all variables in the model. Using recent concentration of measure results, we show that the bias introduced by the asynchronicity is of smaller order than the standard deviation of the function value already present in the true model.

We obtain our learning results in two settings. The first is the commonly studied setting where sample access to the bidders\\' distributions over valuations is given, for both regular distributions and arbitrary distributions with bounded support. Our algorithms require polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. The second is a more general max-min learning setting that we introduce, where we are given \"approximate distributions,\" and we seek to compute an auction whose revenue is approximately optimal simultaneously for all \"true distributions\" that are close to the given ones. These results are more general in that they imply the sample-based results, and are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the underlying distributions but have estimated them indirectly via market research or by observation of previously run, potentially non-truthful auctions.\\n  Our results hold for valuation distributions satisfying the standard (and necessary) independence-across-items property. They also generalize and improve upon recent works, which have provided algorithms that learn approximately optimal auctions in more restricted settings with additive, subadditive and unit-demand valuations using sample access to distributions. We generalize these results to the complete unit-demand, additive, and XOS setting, to i.i.d. subadditive bidders, and to the max-min setting.\\n  Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence bounds for hypotheses classes under product measures. Our bounds result in exponential savings in sample complexity compared to bounds derived by bounding the VC dimension, and are of independent interest.\\n        ',\n",

This question of \"identity testing\" has received significant attention in the case of testing whether $p$ and $q$ are equal or far in total variation distance. However, in recent work, the following questions have been been critical to solving problems at the frontiers of distribution testing:\\n  -Alternative Distances: Can we test whether $p$ and $q$ are far in other distances, say Hellinger?\\n  -Tolerance: Can we test when $p$ and $q$ are close, rather than equal? And if so, close in which distances?\\n  Motivated by these questions, we characterize the complexity of distribution testing under a variety of distances, including total variation, $\\\\ell_2$, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, and $œá^2$. For each pair of distances $d_1$ and $d_2$, we study the complexity of testing if $p$ and $q$ are close in $d_1$ versus far in $d_2$, with a focus on identifying which problems allow strongly sublinear testers (i.e., those with complexity $O(n^{1 - Œ≥})$ for some $Œ≥> 0$ where $n$ is the size of the support of the distributions $p$ and $q$). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for each case. We also study these questions in the case where we only have samples from $q$ (equivalence testing), showing qualitative differences from identity testing in terms of when tolerance can be achieved. Our algorithms fall into the classical paradigm of $œá^2$-statistics, but require crucial changes to handle the challenges introduced by each distance we consider. Finally, we survey other recent results in an attempt to serve as a reference for the complexity of various distribution testing problems.\\n        ',\n",

In particular, we observe a single trajectory X0,...,Xt,... of an unknown, symmetric, and finite state Markov Chain M. We do not control the starting state X0, and we cannot restart the chain. Given our single trajectory, the goal is to test whether M is identical to a model Markov Chain M0 , or far from it under an appropriate notion of difference. We propose a measure of difference between two Markov chains, motivated by the early work of Kazakos [Kaz78], which captures the scaling behavior of the total variation distance between trajectories sampled from the Markov chains as the length of these trajectories grows. We provide efficient testers and information-theoretic lower bounds for testing identity of symmetric Markov chains under our proposed measure of difference, which are tight up to logarithmic factors if the hitting times of the model chain M0 is O(n) in the size of the state space n.\\n        ',\n",

It is a common experience, however, that iterative maps fail to be globally contracting under the natural metric in their domain, making the applicability of Banach's theorem limited. We explore how generally we can apply Banach's fixed point theorem to establish the convergence of iterative methods when pairing it with carefully designed metrics.\\n  Our first result is a strong converse of Banach's theorem, showing that it is a universal analysis tool for establishing global convergence of iterative methods to unique fixed points, and for bounding their convergence rate. In other words, we show that, whenever an iterative map globally converges to a unique fixed point, there exists a metric under which the iterative map is contracting and which can be used to bound the number of iterations until convergence. We illustrate our approach in the widely used power method, providing a new way of bounding its convergence rate through contraction arguments.\\n  We next consider the computational complexity of Banach's fixed point theorem. Making the proof of our converse theorem constructive, we show that computing a fixed point whose existence is guaranteed by Banach's fixed point theorem is CLS-complete. We thus provide the first natural complete problem for the class CLS, which was defined in [Daskalakis, Papadimitriou 2011] to capture the complexity of problems such as P-matrix LCP, computing KKT-points, and finding mixed Nash equilibria in congestion and network coordination games.\\n        \",\n",

Importantly, our bound does not involve the conditionals but the marginals of $P$ and $Q$. We derive a similar inequality for more general Markov Random Fields.\\n  As an application of our inequality, we show that distinguishing whether two Bayesian networks $P$ and $Q$ on the same (but potentially unknown) DAG satisfy $P=Q$ vs $d_{\\\\rm TV}(P,Q)>Œµ$ can be performed from $\\\\tilde{O}(|Œ£|^{3/4(d+1)} \\\\cdot n/Œµ^2)$ samples, where $d$ is the maximum in-degree of the DAG and $Œ£$ the domain of each variable of the Bayesian networks. If $P$ and $Q$ are defined on potentially different and potentially unknown trees, the sample complexity becomes $\\\\tilde{O}(|Œ£|^{4.5} n/Œµ^2)$, whose dependence on $n, Œµ$ is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

These problems of testing independence and goodness-of-fit have received enormous attention in statistics, information theory, and theoretical computer science, with sample-optimal algorithms known in several interesting regimes of parameters. Unfortunately, it has also been understood that these problems become intractable in large dimensions, necessitating exponential sample complexity.\\n  Motivated by the exponential lower bounds for general distributions as well as the ubiquity of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) in the modeling of high-dimensional distributions, we initiate the study of distribution testing on structured multivariate distributions, and in particular the prototypical example of MRFs: the Ising Model. We demonstrate that, in this structured setting, we can avoid the curse of dimensionality, obtaining sample and time efficient testers for independence and goodness-of-fit.

For estimating mixtures of Gaussians, its iteration can be viewed as a soft version of the k-means clustering algorithm. Despite its wide use and applications, there are essentially no known convergence guarantees for this method. We provide global convergence guarantees for mixtures of two Gaussians with known covariance matrices. We show that the population version of EM, where the algorithm is given access to infinitely many samples from the mixture, converges geometrically to the correct mean vectors, and provide simple, closed-form expressions for the convergence rate. As a simple illustration, we show that, in one dimension, ten steps of the EM algorithm initialized at infinity result in less than 1\\\\% error estimation of the means. In the finite sample regime, we show that, under a random initialization, $\\\\tilde{O}(d/Œµ^2)$ samples suffice to compute the unknown vectors to within $Œµ$ in Mahalanobis distance, where $d$ is the dimension.

We target mechanisms that are Bayesian Incentive Compatible, but that are ex-post Individually Rational and ex-post budget respecting. Virtually no such mechanisms are known that satisfy all these conditions and guarantee any revenue approximation, even with just a single item. We provide a computationally efficient mechanism that is a $3$-approximation with respect to all BIC, ex-post IR, and ex-post budget respecting mechanisms. Note that the problem is NP-hard to approximate better than a factor of 16/15, even in the case where the prior is a point mass \\\\cite{ChakrabartyGoel}.

Our main technical contribution is a computationally efficient $3$-approximation algorithm for the algorithmic problem that results by an application of their framework to this problem. The algorithmic problem has a mixed-sign objective and is NP-hard to optimize exactly, so it is surprising that a computationally efficient approximation is possible at all. In the case of a single item ($m=1$), the algorithmic problem can be solved exactly via exhaustive search, leading to a computationally efficient exact algorithm and a stronger characterization of the optimal mechanism as a distribution over virtual value maximizers.\\n        ',\n",

We show that the optimum mechanism can be computed by solving a nested sequence of static (single-period) mechanisms that optimize a tradeoff between the surplus of the allocation and the buyer\\'s utility. We also provide a simple dynamic mechanism that obtains at least half of the optimal revenue. The mechanism either ignores history and posts the optimal monopoly price in each period, or allocates with a probability that is independent of the current report of the agent and is based only on previous reports. Our characterization extends to multi-agent auctions. We also formulate a discounted infinite horizon version of the problem, where we study the performance of \"Markov mechanisms.\"\\n        ',\n",

In turn, our stronger CLT can be leveraged to obtain an efficient PTAS for approximate Nash equilibria in anonymous games, significantly improving the state of the art, and matching qualitatively the running time dependence on $n$ and $1/\\\\varepsilon$ of the best known algorithm for two-strategy anonymous games. Our new CLT also enables the construction of covers for the set of $(n,k)$-PMDs, which are proper and whose size is shown to be essentially optimal.

These guarantees hold even when the auctions are repeatedly executed and players use no-regret learning algorithms. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf no-regret algorithms for these auctions are computationally inefficient as the number of actions is exponential. We show that this obstacle is insurmountable: there are no polynomial-time no-regret algorithms for SiSPAs, unless RP$\\\\supseteq$ NP, even when the bidders are unit-demand. Our lower bound raises the question of how good outcomes polynomially-bounded bidders may discover in such auctions.\\n  To answer this question, we propose a novel concept of learning in auctions, termed \"no-envy learning.\" This notion is founded upon Walrasian equilibrium, and we show that it is both efficiently implementable and results in approximately optimal welfare, even when the bidders have fractionally subadditive (XOS) valuations (assuming demand oracles) or coverage valuations (without demand oracles). No-envy learning outcomes are a relaxation of no-regret outcomes, which maintain their approximate welfare optimality while endowing them with computational tractability. Our results extend to other auction formats that have been studied in the literature via the smoothness paradigm.\\n  Our results for XOS valuations are enabled by a novel Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader algorithm for settings where the number of experts is infinite, and the payoff function of the learner is non-linear. This algorithm has applications outside of auction settings, such as in security games. Our result for coverage valuations is based on a novel use of convex rounding schemes and a reduction to online convex optimization.\\n        ',\n",

Modern data sets often contain a large number of genes, which can complicate the reconstruction problem due to the fact that different genes may undergo different evolutionary histories. This is the case in particular in the presence of horizontal genetic transfer (HGT), where a gene is inherited from a distant species rather than an immediate ancestor. Such an event produces a gene tree which is distinct from, but related to, the species phylogeny.\\n  In previous work, a natural stochastic models of HGT was introduced and studied. It was shown, both in simulation and theoretical studies, that a species phylogeny can be reconstructed from gene trees despite surprisingly high rates of HGT under this model. Rigorous lower and upper bounds on this achievable rate were also obtained, but a large gap remained. Here we close this gap, up to a constant. Specifically we show that a species phylogeny can be reconstructed correctly from gene trees even when, on each gene, each edge of the species tree has a constant probability of being the location of an HGT event. Our new reconstruction algorithm, which relies only on unrooted gene tree topologies, builds the tree recursively from the leaves and runs in polynomial time.\\n  We also provide a matching bound in the negative direction (up to a constant) and extend our results to some cases where gene trees are not perfectly known.\\n        ',\n",

We also show that it is intractable to optimally price the grand bundle of multiple items for an additive bidder whose values for the items are independent. These difficulties stem from implicit definitions of a value distribution. We provide three instances of how different properties of implicit distributions can lead to intractability: the first is a #P-hardness proof, while the remaining two are reductions from the SQRT-SUM problem of Garey, Graham, and Johnson. While simple pricing schemes can oftentimes approximate the best scheme in revenue, they can have drastically different underlying structure.

For each of these variants, and many of the subsets of $\\\\{+,-,\\\\times,√∑\\\\}$, we prove the problem NP-complete, sometimes in the weak sense and sometimes in the strong sense.

Our algorithm uses $O(n^2)$ pivot moves, which is worst-case optimal. Previous reconfiguration algorithms either require less restrictive \"sliding\" moves, do not preserve facet-connectivity, or for the setting we consider, could only handle a small subset of configurations defined by a local forbidden pattern. Configurations with the forbidden pattern do have disconnected reconfiguration graphs (discrete configuration spaces), and indeed we show that they can have an exponential number of connected components. But forbidding the local pattern throughout the configuration is far from necessary, as we show that just a constant number of added modules (placed to be freely reconfigurable) suffice for universal reconfigurability.

Thus, circles (eccentricity 0) and parabolas (eccentricity 1) are compatible with only themselves (when scaled from a focus), and ellipses (eccentricity strictly between 0 and 1) and hyperbolas (eccentricity above 1) are compatible with themselves and each other (but only in specific pairings).

Unlike flat foldability of origami or flexibility of other kinematic linkages, whose complexity originates in the complexity of the layer ordering and possible self-intersection of the material, rigid foldability from a planar state is hard even though there is no potential self-intersection. In fact, the complexity comes from the combinatorial behavior of the different possible rigid folding configurations at each vertex. The results underpin the fact that it is harder to fold from an unfolded sheet of paper than to unfold a folded state back to a plane, frequently encountered problem when realizing folding-based systems such as self-folding matter and reconfigurable robots.\\n        ',\n",

In all puzzles, the goal is to draw a simple path in a rectangular grid graph from a start vertex to a destination vertex. The different puzzle types place different constraints on the path: preventing some edges from being visited (broken edges); forcing some edges or vertices to be visited (hexagons); forcing some cells to have certain numbers of incident path edges (triangles); or forcing the regions formed by the path to be partially monochromatic (squares), have exactly two special cells (stars), or be singly covered by given shapes (polyominoes) and/or negatively counting shapes (antipolyominoes). We show that any one of these clue types (except the first) is enough to make path finding NP-complete (\"witnesses exist but are hard to find\"), even for rectangular boards. Furthermore, we show that a final clue type (antibody), which necessarily \"cancels\" the effect of another clue in the same region, makes path finding $Œ£_2$-complete (\"witnesses do not exist\"), even with a single antibody (combined with many anti/polyominoes), and the problem gets no harder with many antibodies.

We take the reductions and techniques from complexity and fine-grained complexity and apply them to the I/O model to generate new (conditional) lower bounds as well as faster algorithms. We also prove the existence of a time hierarchy for the I/O model, which motivates the fine-grained reductions.\\n  Using fine-grained reductions, we give an algorithm for distinguishing 2 vs. 3 diameter and radius that runs in $O(|E|^2/(MB))$ cache misses, which for sparse graphs improves over the previous $O(|V|^2/B)$ running time. We give new reductions from radius and diameter to Wiener index and median. We show meaningful reductions between problems that have linear-time solutions in the RAM model. The reductions use low I/O complexity (typically $O(n/B)$), and thus help to finely capture the relationship between \"I/O linear time\" $Œò(n/B)$ and RAM linear time $Œò(n)$. We generate new I/O assumptions based on the difficulty of improving sparse graph problem running times in the I/O model. We create conjectures that the current best known algorithms for Single Source Shortest Paths (SSSP), diameter, and radius are optimal. From these I/O-model assumptions, we show that many of the known reductions in the word-RAM model can naturally extend to hold in the I/O model as well (e.g., a lower bound on the I/O complexity of Longest Common Subsequence that matches the best known running time).

In this paper, we prove two of these unsolved combinations to be NP-complete: Hamiltonicity of Square Polygonal Grid Graphs and Hamiltonicity of Hexagonal Thin Grid Graphs. We also consider a new restriction, where the grid graph is both thin and polygonal, and prove that Hamiltonicity then becomes polynomially solvable for square, triangular, and hexagonal grid graphs.\\n        ',\n",

The two results which we expect to be most generally applicable are that (1) TRVB is polynomially solvable when breakable vertices are restricted to have degree at most $3$; and (2) for any $k \\\\ge 4$, TRVB is NP-complete when the given multigraph is restricted to be planar and to consist entirely of degree-$k$ breakable vertices. To demonstrate the use of TRVB, we give a simple proof of the known result that Hamiltonicity in max-degree-$3$ square grid graphs is NP-hard.\\n  We also demonstrate a connection between TRVB and the Hypergraph Spanning Tree problem. This connection allows us to show that the Hypergraph Spanning Tree problem in $k$-uniform $2$-regular hypergraphs is NP-complete for any $k \\\\ge 4$, even when the incidence graph of the hypergraph is planar.\\n        ',\n",

Such colorings have applications in wireless networking, robotics, and geometry, and are well-studied in graph theory. Here we study the natural problem of the conflict-free chromatic number chi_CF(G) (the smallest k for which conflict-free k-colorings exist). We provide results both for closed neighborhoods N[v], for which a vertex v is a member of its neighborhood, and for open neighborhoods N(v), for which vertex v is not a member of its neighborhood.\\n  For closed neighborhoods, we prove the conflict-free variant of the famous Hadwiger Conjecture: If an arbitrary graph G does not contain K_{k+1} as a minor, then chi_CF(G) <= k. For planar graphs, we obtain a tight worst-case bound: three colors are sometimes necessary and always sufficient. We also give a complete characterization of the computational complexity of conflict-free coloring. Deciding whether chi_CF(G)<= 1 is NP-complete for planar graphs G, but polynomial for outerplanar graphs. Furthermore, deciding whether chi_CF(G)<= 2 is NP-complete for planar graphs G, but always true for outerplanar graphs. For the bicriteria problem of minimizing the number of colored vertices subject to a given bound k on the number of colors, we give a full algorithmic characterization in terms of complexity and approximation for outerplanar and planar graphs.\\n  For open neighborhoods, we show that every planar bipartite graph has a conflict-free coloring with at most four colors; on the other hand, we prove that for k in {1,2,3}, it is NP-complete to decide whether a planar bipartite graph has a conflict-free k-coloring.

Though it provides ideal security, FHE is expensive when executed in software, 4 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than computing on unencrypted data. These overheads are a major barrier to FHE's widespread adoption. We present F1, the first FHE accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs. F1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE computations that reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector processor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives, such as modular arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and structured permutations. This organization provides so much compute throughput that data movement becomes the bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize data movement. The F1 hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and mechanisms to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler leverages these mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip data movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulations and RTL synthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs and outperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5400x and by up to 17000x. These speedups counter most of FHE's overheads and enable new applications, like real-time private deep learning in the cloud.\\n        \",\n",

The irregularity of such data violates some key assumptions used in almost all existing DP-SCO and DP-ERM methods, resulting in failure to provide the DP guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework, which has an excess population risk of $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\frac{d^3}{nŒµ^4})$ (after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the \\\\textit{expected} excess population risk to $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\frac{ d^2}{ nŒµ^2 })$. To lift these additional conditions, we also provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based scheme to achieve excess population risks of $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\frac{ d^2}{nŒµ^2})$ and $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\frac{d^\\\\frac{2}{3}}{(nŒµ^2)^\\\\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly convex and general convex loss functions, respectively, \\\\textit{with high probability}.

This makes it difficult for them to meet the scalability, heterogeneity, availability, and security challenges in current cloud and parallel computing environments. To address these problems, we propose a radically new OS design based on data-centric architecture: all operating system state should be represented uniformly as database tables, and operations on this state should be made via queries from otherwise stateless tasks. This design makes it easy to scale and evolve the OS without whole-system refactoring, inspect and debug system state, upgrade components without downtime, manage decisions using machine learning, and implement sophisticated security features.

However, analytics workloads are often bursty or low volume, leaving clusters idle much of the time, meaning customers pay for compute resources even when unused. The ability of cloud function services, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to run small, fine granularity tasks make them appear to be a natural choice for query processing in such settings. But implementing an analytics system on cloud functions comes with its own set of challenges. These include managing hundreds of tiny stateless resource-constrained workers, handling stragglers, and shuffling data through opaque cloud services. In this paper we present Starling, a query execution engine built on cloud function services that employs number of techniques to mitigate these challenges, providing interactive query latency at a lower total cost than provisioned systems with low-to-moderate utilization. In particular, on a 1TB TPC-H dataset in cloud storage, Starling is less expensive than the best provisioned systems for workloads when queries arrive 1 minute apart or more. Starling also has lower latency than competing systems reading from cloud object stores and can scale to larger datasets.\\n        ',\n",

Prior work uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect which pixels belong to a road (segmentation), and then uses complex post-processing heuristics to infer graph connectivity. We show that these segmentation methods have high error rates because noisy CNN outputs are difficult to correct. We propose RoadTracer, a new method to automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images. RoadTracer uses an iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive the road network graph directly from the output of the CNN. We compare our approach with a segmentation method on fifteen cities, and find that at a 5% error rate, RoadTracer correctly captures 45% more junctions across these cities.\\n        ',\n",

Traditionally, cluster management systems such as Condor employ a process-oriented approach with little or no use of modern database system technology. In contrast, CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution. Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract, higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000 nodes).\\n        \",\n",

Next-generation science instruments and simulations will generate these peta-scale datasets. The need to publish and share data and the need for generic analysis and visualization tools will finally create a convergence on common metadata standards. Database systems will be judged by their support of these metadata standards and by their ability to manage and access peta-scale datasets.

       " '\\n        Many application domains, spanning from computational photography to medical imaging, require recovery of high-fidelity images from noisy, incomplete or partial/compressed measurements. State of the art methods for solving these inverse problems combine deep learning with iterative model-based solvers, a concept known as deep algorithm unfolding. By combining a-priori knowledge of the forward measurement model with learned (proximal) mappings based on deep networks, these methods yield solutions that are both physically feasible (data-consistent) and perceptually plausible. However, current proximal mappings only implicitly learn such image priors. In this paper, we propose to make these image priors fully explicit by embedding deep generative models in the form of normalizing flows within the unfolded proximal gradient algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive baselines on various image recovery tasks, spanning from image denoising to inpainting and deblurring.\\n        ',\n",

This is a fourth-order inverse problem, as we are trying to recover factors of matrix that have been put through a quadratic nonlinearity after being multiplied together.\\n  We propose a solution to this problem using the recently introduced technique of anchored regression. This approach uses two different types of convex relaxations: we replace the quadratic equality constraints for the phaseless measurements by a search over a polytope, and enforce the rank constraint through nuclear norm regularization. The result is a convex program that works in the space of $d_1 \\\\times d_2$ matrices.\\n  We analyze two specific scenarios. In the first, the target matrix is rank-$1$, and the observations are structured to correspond to a phaseless blind deconvolution. In the second, the target matrix has general rank, and we observe the magnitudes of the inner products against a series of independent Gaussian random matrices. In each of these problems, we show that the anchored regression returns an accurate estimate from a near-optimal number of measurements given that we have access to an anchor matrix of sufficient quality. We also show how to create such an anchor in the phaseless blind deconvolution problem, again from an optimal number of measurements, and present a partial result in this direction for the general rank problem.\\n        ',\n",

Classically, such problems have been dealt with parameter estimation methods. Recently, it has been shown that convex-optimization based formulations facilitate a continuous time solution to the super-resolution problem. Here we treat super-resolution from low-pass measurements in Phase Space. The Phase Space transformation parametrically generalizes a number of well known unitary mappings such as the Fractional Fourier, Fresnel, Laplace and Fourier transforms. Consequently, our work provides a general super- resolution strategy which is backward compatible with the usual Fourier domain result. We consider low-pass measurements of Dirac distributions in Phase Space and show that the super-resolution problem can be cast as Total Variation minimization. Remarkably, even though are setting is quite general, the bounds on the minimum separation distance of Dirac distributions is comparable to existing methods.\\n        ',\n",

We demonstrate empirically that any complex-valued object can be recovered from the knowledge of the magnitude of just a few diffracted patterns by solving a simple convex optimization problem inspired by the recent literature on matrix completion. More importantly, we also demonstrate that our noise-aware algorithms are stable in the sense that the reconstruction degrades gracefully as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases.

       " '\\n        Sparse modeling is a powerful framework for data analysis and processing. Traditionally, encoding in this framework is performed by solving an L1-regularized linear regression problem, commonly referred to as Lasso or Basis Pursuit. In this work we combine the sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso model at the individual feature level, with the block-sparsity property of the Group Lasso model, where sparse groups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern hierarchically structured. This results in the Hierarchical Lasso (HiLasso), which shows important practical modeling advantages. We then extend this approach to the collaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same sparsity pattern at the higher (group) level, but not necessarily at the lower (inside the group) level, obtaining the collaborative HiLasso model (C-HiLasso). Such signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily the same active set. This model is very well suited for applications such as source identification and separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The underlying presentation of the new framework and optimization approach is complemented with experimental examples and theoretical results regarding recovery guarantees for the proposed models.\\n        ',\n",

A central task in the analysis of aCGH data is the segmentation into groups of probes sharing the same DNA copy number. Some well known segmentation methods suffer from very long running times, preventing interactive data analysis. Results: We suggest a new segmentation method based on wavelet decomposition and thresholding, which detects significant breakpoints in the data. Our algorithm is over 1,000 times faster than leading approaches, with similar performance. Another key advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity and flexibility. Due to its intuitive structure it can be easily generalized to incorporate several types of side information. Here we consider two extensions which include side information indicating the reliability of each measurement, and compensating for a changing variability in the measurement noise. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing methods, both in terms of speed and performance, when applied on real high density CGH data.

Here we concentrate on quantum state detection using the worst-case a posteriori probability of detection as the design criterion. This objective is equivalent to asking the question: if the detector declares that a specific state is present, what is the probability of that state actually being present? We show that maximizing this worst-case probability (maximizing the smallest possible value of this probability) is a quasiconvex optimization over the matrices of the POVM (positive operator valued measure) which characterize the measurement apparatus. We also show that with a given POVM, the optimization is quasiconvex in the matrix which characterizes the Kraus operator sum representation (OSR) in a fixed basis. We use Lagrange Duality Theory to establish the optimality conditions for both deterministic and randomized detection. We also examine the special case of detecting a single pure state.

To improve scalability, we propose a digital optical neural network (DONN) with intralayer optical interconnects and reconfigurable input values. The near path-length-independence of optical energy consumption enables information locality between a transmitter and arbitrarily arranged receivers, which allows greater flexibility in architecture design to circumvent scaling limitations. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate optical multicast in the classification of 500 MNIST images with a 3-layer, fully-connected network.

Such an evaluation requires error propagation all the way from particle strikes on low-level state up to the program output. Existing approaches that rely on low-level simulations with fault injection cannot evaluate full applications because of their slow speeds, while application-level accelerated fault testing in accelerated particle beams is often impractical. We present a new two-level methodology for application resilience evaluation that overcomes these challenges. The proposed approach decomposes application failure rate estimation into (1) identifying how particle strikes in low-level unprotected state manifest at the architecture-level, and (2) measuring how such architecture-level manifestations propagate to the program output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on GPU architectures. We also show that using just one of the two steps can overestimate SDC rates and produce different trends---the composition of the two is needed for accurate reliability modeling.\\n        ',\n",

These endeavors aim to reduce the DNN model size and improve the hardware processing efficiency, and have resulted in DNNs that are much more compact in their structures and/or have high data sparsity. These compact or sparse models are different from the traditional large ones in that there is much more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement. Thus, many DNN accelerators designed for large DNNs do not perform well on these models. In this work, we present Eyeriss v2, a DNN accelerator architecture designed for running compact and sparse DNNs. To deal with the widely varying layer shapes and sizes, it introduces a highly flexible on-chip network, called hierarchical mesh, that can adapt to the different amounts of data reuse and bandwidth requirements of different data types, which improves the utilization of the computation resources. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 can process sparse data directly in the compressed domain for both weights and activations, and therefore is able to improve both processing speed and energy efficiency with sparse models. Overall, with sparse MobileNet, Eyeriss v2 in a 65nm CMOS process achieves a throughput of 1470.6 inferences/sec and 2560.3 inferences/J at a batch size of 1, which is 12.6x faster and 2.5x more energy efficient than the original Eyeriss running MobileNet.

This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator applied during inference. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to the multiplier array, where they are extensively reused. In addition, the accumulation of multiplication products are performed in a novel accumulator array. Our results show that on contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.\\n        ',\n",

While modern assembly processes can easily integrate thousands of electrical components onto a single board, photonic assembly is far more challenging due to the wavelength-scale alignment tolerances required. Here we address this problem by introducing an alignment-free photonic coupler robust to x, y, z displacement and angular misalignment. This alignment-free coupler engineers a translationally-invariant evanescent interaction between waveguides by intersecting them at an angle, which enables a lateral and angular alignment tolerance fundamentally larger than non-evanescent approaches such as edge coupling. We show that our approach can function as a universal photonic connector interfacing photonic integrated circuits and microchiplets across different platforms. As a potential use case, we describe a new type of self-aligning photonic circuit board enabled by our approach that greatly simplifies assembly of complex optoelectronic systems.\\n        ',\n",

Here, we provide efficient quantum algorithms for performing linear group convolutions and cross-correlations on data stored as quantum states. Runtimes for our algorithms are logarithmic in the dimension of the group thus offering an exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms when input data is provided as a quantum state and linear operations are well conditioned. Motivated by the rich literature on quantum algorithms for solving algebraic problems, our theoretical framework opens a path for quantizing many algorithms in machine learning and numerical methods that employ group operations.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Component errors limit the scaling of multiport interferometers based on MZI meshes. These errors arise because imperfect MZIs cannot be perfectly programmed to the cross state. Here, we introduce two modified mesh architectures that overcome this limitation: (1) a 3-splitter MZI for generic errors, and (2) a broadband MZI+Crossing design for correlated errors. Because these designs allow for perfect realization of the cross state, the matrix fidelity no longer decreases with mesh size, allowing scaling to arbitrarily large meshes. The proposed architectures support progressive self-configuration, are more compact than previous MZI-doubling schemes, and do not require additional phase shifters. This eliminates a major obstacle to the development of very-large-scale linear photonic circuits.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        Quantum sensors based on spin defect ensembles have seen rapid development in recent years, with a wide array of target applications. Historically, these sensors have used optical methods to prepare or read out quantum states. However, these methods are limited to optically-polarizable spin defects, and the spin ensemble size is typically limited by the available optical power or acceptable optical heat load. We demonstrate a solid-state sensor employing a non-optical state preparation technique, which harnesses thermal population imbalances induced by the defect's zero-field splitting. Readout is performed using the recently-demonstrated microwave cavity readout technique, resulting in a sensor architecture that is entirely non-optical and broadly applicable to all solid-state paramagnetic defects with a zero-field splitting. The implementation in this work uses Cr$^{3+}$ defects in a sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$) crystal and a simple microwave architecture where the host crystal also serves as the high quality-factor resonator. This approach yields a near-unity filling factor and high single-spin-photon coupling, producing a magnetometer with a broadband sensitivity of 9.7 pT/$\\\\sqrt{\\\\text{Hz}}$.\\n        \",\n",

However, its weak strength often requires resonators to confine and store the photons. Here, we present mode engineering techniques to create resonators with ultrasmall mode volume and ultrahigh quality factor. In particular, we show that it is possible to achieve an arbitrarily small mode volume only limited by materials or fabrication with minimal Q degradation. We compare mode-engineered cavities in a trade-off space and show that the magnetic interaction can be strengthened more than $10^{16}$ times compared to free space. These methods enable new applications from high-cooperativity microwave-spin coupling in quantum computing or compact electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) sensors to fundamental science such as dark matter searches.\\n        ',\n",

The approach uses out-of-plane phase modulation programmed down to $N^2$ degrees of freedom. The total area of these modulators equals that of the entire slab: our scheme satisfies the minimum area constraint for programmable linear optical transformations. We also present error correction schemes that enable high-fidelity unitary transformations at large $N$. This ``programmable multimode interferometer'' (ProMMI) thus translates the algorithmic simplicity of Mach-Zehnder meshes into a holographically programmed slab, yielding DoF-limited compactness and error tolerance while eliminating the dominant sidewall-related optical losses and directional-coupler-related patterning challenges.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        Realistic multiport interferometers (beamsplitter meshes) are sensitive to component imperfections, and this sensitivity increases with size. Self-configuration techniques can be employed to correct these imperfections, but not all techniques are equal. This paper highlights the importance of algorithmic stability in self-configuration. Naive approaches based on sequentially setting matrix elements are unstable and perform poorly for large meshes, while techniques based on power ratios perform well in all cases, even in the presence of large errors. Based on this insight, we propose a self-configuration scheme for triangular meshes that requires only external detectors and works without prior knowledge of the component imperfections. This scheme extends to the rectangular mesh by adding a single array of detectors along the diagonal.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Multiport interferometers based on integrated beamsplitter meshes are widely used in photonic technologies. While the rectangular mesh is favored for its compactness and uniformity, its geometry resists conventional self-configuration approaches, which are essential to programming large meshes in the presence of fabrication error. Here, we present a new configuration algorithm, related to the $2\\\\times 2$ block decomposition of a unitary matrix, that overcomes this limitation. Our proposed algorithm is robust to errors, requires no prior knowledge of the process variations, and relies only on external sources and detectors. We show that self-configuration using this technique reduces the effect of fabrication errors by the same quadratic factor observed in triangular meshes. This relaxes a significant limit to the size of multiport interferometers, removing a major roadblock to the scaling of optical quantum and machine-learning hardware.\\n        ',\n",

The negatively charged tin-vacancy center (SnV) is particularly interesting, as its large spin-orbit coupling offers strong protection against phonon dephasing and robust cyclicity of its optical transitions towards spin-photon entanglement schemes. Here, we demonstrate multi-axis coherent control of the SnV spin qubit via an all-optical stimulated Raman drive between the ground and excited states. We use coherent population trapping and optically driven electronic spin resonance to confirm coherent access to the qubit at 1.7 K, and obtain spin Rabi oscillations at a rate of $Œ©/2œÄ$=3.6(1) MHz. All-optical Ramsey interferometry reveals a spin dephasing time of $T_2^*$=1.3(3)$Œº$s and two-pulse dynamical decoupling already extends the spin coherence time to $T_2$=0.33(14) ms. Combined with transform-limited photons and integration into photonic nanostructures, our results make the SnV a competitive spin-photon building block for quantum networks.\\n        ',\n",

PMMIs serve critical functions in photonic quantum information processing, quantum-enhanced sensor networks, machine learning and other applications. However, PMMI implementations reported to date rely on thermo-optic phase shifters, which limit applications due to slow response times and high power consumption. Here, we introduce a large-scale PMMI platform, based on a 200 mm CMOS process, that uses aluminum nitride (AlN) piezo-optomechanical actuators coupled to silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides, enabling low-loss propagation with phase modulation at greater than 100 MHz in the visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Moreover, the vanishingly low holding-power consumption of the piezo-actuators enables these PICs to operate at cryogenic temperatures, paving the way for a fully integrated device architecture for a range of quantum applications.\\n        ',\n",

Here, we propose a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture integrated with solid-state memories as a viable platform for constructing a qRAM. We also present an alternative scheme based on quantum teleportation and extend it to the context of quantum networks. Both implementations rely on already demonstrated components: electro-optic modulators, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) network, and nanocavities coupled to artificial atoms for spin-based memory writing and retrieval. Our approaches furthermore benefit from built-in error-detection based on photon heralding. Detailed theoretical analysis of the qRAM efficiency and query fidelity shows that our proposal presents viable near-term designs for a general qRAM.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        Increasing demand for algorithms that can learn quickly and efficiently has led to a surge of development within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). An important paradigm within AI is reinforcement learning (RL), where agents interact with environments by exchanging signals via a communication channel. Agents can learn by updating their behaviour based on obtained feedback. The crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents can learn to respond correctly. An essential figure of merit is therefore the learning time. While various works have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent's decision-making process, a reduction in learning time has not been demonstrated yet. Here we present a RL experiment where the learning of an agent is boosted by utilizing a quantum communication channel with the environment. We further show that the combination with classical communication enables the evaluation of such an improvement, and additionally allows for optimal control of the learning progress. This novel scenario is therefore demonstrated by considering hybrid agents, that alternate between rounds of quantum and classical communication. We implement this learning protocol on a compact and fully tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. The device interfaces with telecom-wavelength photons and features a fast active feedback mechanism, allowing us to demonstrate the agent's systematic quantum advantage in a setup that could be readily integrated within future large-scale quantum communication networks.\\n        \",\n",

A major obstacle to scaling up these systems is static fabrication error, where small component errors within each device accrue to produce significant errors within the circuit computation. Mitigating this error usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback from the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here we present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally correcting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our approach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite impulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that they remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process tolerances. Our results highlight a new avenue for scaling up programmable photonics to hundreds of modes within current day fabrication processes.\\n        ',\n",

Among these, Group IV-vacancy defect centers have attracted great interest as coherent and stable optical interfaces to long-lived spin states. Theory indicates that their inversion symmetry provides first-order insensitivity to stray electric fields, a common limitation for optical coherence in any host material. Here we experimentally quantify this electric field dependence via an external electric field applied to individual tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond. These measurements reveal that the permanent electric dipole moment and polarizability are at least four orders of magnitude smaller than for the diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, representing the first direct measurement of the inversion symmetry protection of a Group IV defect in diamond. Moreover, we show that by modulating the electric-field-induced dipole we can use the SnV as a nanoscale probe of local electric field noise, and we employ this technique to highlight the effect of spectral diffusion on the SnV.\\n        ',\n",

Here, we report a new series of low energy excitonic emission lines in the photoluminescence spectrum of ultraclean monolayer WSe2. These excitonic satellites are composed of three major peaks with energy separations matching known phonons, and appear only with electron doping. They possess homogenous spatial and spectral distribution, strong power saturation, and anomalously long population (> 6 $Œº$s) and polarization lifetimes (> 100 ns). Resonant excitation of the free inter- and intra-valley bright trions leads to opposite optical orientation of the satellites, while excitation of the free dark trion resonance suppresses the satellites photoluminescence. Defect-controlled crystal synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements provide corroboration that these features are dark excitons bound to dilute donors, along with associated phonon replicas. Our work opens opportunities to engineer homogenous single emitters and explore collective quantum optical phenomena using intrinsic donor-bound excitons in ultraclean 2D semiconductors.\\n        ',\n",

Because fluorescence-based ODMR techniques are limited by low photon collection efficiency and modulation contrast, there has been growing interest in infrared (IR)-absorption-based readout of the NV singlet state transition. IR readout can improve contrast and collection efficiency, but it has thus far been limited to long-pathlength geometries in bulk samples due to the small absorption cross section of the NV singlet state. Here, we amplify the IR absorption by introducing a resonant diamond metallodielectric metasurface that achieves a quality factor of Q ~ 1,000. This \"plasmonic quantum sensing metasurface\" (PQSM) combines localized surface plasmon polariton resonances with long-range Rayleigh-Wood anomaly modes and achieves the desired balance between field localization and sensing volume to optimize spin readout sensitivity. From combined electromagnetic and rate-equation modeling, we estimate a sensitivity below 1 nT/Hz$^{1/2}$ per um$^2$ of sensing area using numbers for present-day NV diamond samples and fabrication techniques. The proposed PQSM enables a new form of microscopic ODMR sensing with infrared readout near the spin-projection-noise-limited sensitivity, making it appealing for the most demanding applications such as imaging through scattering tissue and spatially-resolved chemical NMR detection.\\n        ',\n",

Here we demonstrate single near-infrared photon detection by coupling photons to the localized surface plasmons of a graphene-based JJ. Using the photon-induced switching statistics of the current-biased JJ, we reveal the critical role of QPs generated by the absorbed photon in the detection mechanism.

However, there also exist obstacles to obtaining this potential speedup in useful problem instances. The essential obstacle for quantum differential equation solving is that outputting useful information may require difficult post-processing, and the essential obstacle for quantum machine learning is that inputting the training set is a difficult task just by itself. In this paper, we demonstrate, when combined, these difficulties solve one another. We show how the output of quantum differential equation solving can serve as the input for quantum machine learning, allowing dynamical analysis in terms of principal components, power spectra, and wavelet decompositions. To illustrate this, we consider continuous time Markov processes on epidemiological and social networks.

Here, we propose a way to produce coherent radiation spanning the THz gap by efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) in low-loss dielectric structures, starting from technologically mature electronic oscillators (EOs) in the ~100 GHz range. To achieve this goal, we introduce hybrid THz-band dielectric cavity designs that combine (1) extreme field concentration in high-quality-factor resonators with (2) nonlinear materials enhanced by phonon resonances. We theoretically predict conversion efficiencies of >$10^3$ %/W and the potential to bridge the THz gap with 1 W of input power.

Here, we demonstrate a novel thermal relaxation calorimetry scheme that allows the first measurements of the electronic heat capacity of graphene Ce. It is enabled by the grouping of a radio-frequency Johnson noise thermometer, which can measure the electronic temperature Te with a measurement sensitivity of Œ¥Te ~ 20 mK, and an ultra-fast photo-mixed optical heater, which can simultaneously modulate Te with a frequency of up to Œ©=0.2 THz. This combination allows record sensitive and record fast measurements of the electronic heat capacity Ce < 10^(-19) J/K, with an electronic thermal relaxation time œÑe < 10^(-13), representing orders of magnitude improvements as compared to previous state-of-the-art calorimeters.

To improve scalability, we propose a digital optical neural network (DONN) with intralayer optical interconnects and reconfigurable input values. The near path-length-independence of optical energy consumption enables information locality between a transmitter and arbitrarily arranged receivers, which allows greater flexibility in architecture design to circumvent scaling limitations. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate optical multicast in the classification of 500 MNIST images with a 3-layer, fully-connected network.

We prove that this powerful network property is not possible to attain with any quantum networking protocol built with Bell measurements and multiplexing alone.

The conventional strategy towards higher-sensitivity bolometry is to nanofabricate an ever-smaller device to augment the thermal response. However, this direction is increasingly more difficult to obtain efficient photon coupling and maintain the material properties in a device with a large surface-to-volume ratio. Here we advance this concept to an ultimately thin bolometric sensor based on monolayer graphene. To utilize its minute electronic specific heat and thermal conductivity, we develop a superconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) Josephson junction bolometer embedded in a microwave resonator of resonant frequency 7.9 GHz with over 99\\\\% coupling efficiency. From the dependence of the Josephson switching current on the operating temperature, charge density, input power, and frequency, we demonstrate a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 7 $\\\\times 10^{-19}$ W/Hz$^{1/2}$, corresponding to an energy resolution of one single photon at 32 GHz and reaching the fundamental limit imposed by intrinsic thermal fluctuation at 0.19 K.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        The ability to communicate quantum information over long distances is of central importance in quantum science and engineering. For example, it enables secure quantum key distribution (QKD) relying on fundamental principles that prohibit the \"cloning\" of unknown quantum states. While QKD is being successfully deployed, its range is currently limited by photon losses and cannot be extended using straightforward measure-and-repeat strategies without compromising its unconditional security. Alternatively, quantum repeaters, which utilize intermediate quantum memory nodes and error correction techniques, can extend the range of quantum channels. However, their implementation remains an outstanding challenge, requiring a combination of efficient and high-fidelity quantum memories, gate operations, and measurements. Here we report the experimental realization of memory-enhanced quantum communication. We use a single solid-state spin memory integrated in a nanophotonic diamond resonator to implement asynchronous Bell-state measurements. This enables a four-fold increase in the secret key rate of measurement device independent (MDI)-QKD over the loss-equivalent direct-transmission method while operating megahertz clock rates. Our results represent a significant step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks.\\n        ',\n",

After decades of advances, SLM arrays based on liquid crystals can now reach large pixel counts exceeding 10^6 with phase-only modulation with a pixel pitch of less than 10 Œºm and reflectance around 75%. However, the rather slow modulation speed in such SLMs (below hundreds of Hz) presents limitations for many applications. Here we propose an SLM architecture that can achieve high pixel count with high-resolution phase-only modulation at high speed in excess of GHz. The architecture consists of a tunable two-dimensional array of vertically oriented, one-sided microcavities that are tuned through an electro-optic material such as barium titanate (BTO). We calculate that the optimized microcavity design achieves a œÄ phase shift under an applied bias voltage below 10 V, while maintaining nearly constant reflection amplitude. As two model applications, we consider high-speed 2D beam steering as well as beam forming. The outlined design methodology could also benefit future design of spatial light modulators with other specifications (for example amplitude modulators). This high-speed SLM architecture promises a wide range of new applications ranging from fully tunable metasurfaces to optical computing accelerators, high-speed interconnects, true 2D phased array beam steering, and quantum computing with cold atom arrays.\\n        ',\n",

Their enormous stretchability gives rise to a strain-engineerable bandgap that has been used to induce static exciton flux in predetermined structures. However, dynamic control of exciton flux represents an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a method to tune the bandgap of suspended 2D semiconductors by applying a local strain gradient with a nanoscale tip. This strain allows us to locally and reversibly shift the exciton energy and to steer the exciton flux over micron-scale distances, as observed by wide-field imaging and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. We anticipate that the ability to strongly and dynamically modulate the bandgap of a semiconductor at the nanoscale not only marks an important experimental tool but will also open a broad range of new applications from information processing to energy conversion.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Quantum algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines have recently emerged as new promising routes towards demonstrating near-term quantum advantage (or supremacy) over classical systems. In these systems samples are typically drawn from probability distributions which --- under plausible complexity-theoretic conjectures --- cannot be efficiently generated classically. Rather than first define a physical system and then determine computational features of the output state, we ask the converse question: given direct access to the quantum state, what features of the generating system can we efficiently learn? In this work we introduce the Variational Quantum Unsampling (VQU) protocol, a nonlinear quantum neural network approach for verification and inference of near-term quantum circuits outputs. In our approach one can variationally train a quantum operation to unravel the action of an unknown unitary on a known input state; essentially learning the inverse of the black-box quantum dynamics. While the principle of our approach is platform independent, its implementation will depend on the unique architecture of a specific quantum processor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the VQU protocol on a quantum photonic processor. Alongside quantum verification, our protocol has broad applications; including optimal quantum measurement and tomography, quantum sensing and imaging, and ansatz validation.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable miniaturization of optical quantum circuits because several optic and electronic functionalities can be added on the same chip. Single photon emitters (SPEs) are central building blocks for such quantum circuits and several approaches have been developed to interface PICs with a host material containing SPEs. SPEs embedded in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides have unique properties that make them particularly appealing as PIC-integrated SPEs. They can be easily interfaced with PICs and stacked together to create complex heterostructures. Since the emitters are embedded in a monolayer there is no total internal reflection, enabling very high light extraction efficiencies without the need of any additional processing to allow efficient single photon transfer between the host and the underlying PIC. Arrays of 2D-based SPEs can moreover be fabricated deterministically through STEM patterning or strain engineering. Finally, 2D materials grown with high wafer-scale uniformity are becoming more readily available, such that they can be matched at the wafer level with underlying PICs. Here we report on the integration of a WSe$_{2}$ monolayer onto a Silicon Nitride (SiN) chip. We demonstrate the coupling of SPEs with the guided mode of a SiN waveguide and study how the on-chip single photon extraction can be maximized by interfacing the 2D-SPE with an integrated dielectric cavity. Our approach allows the use of optimized PIC platforms without the need for additional processing in the host material. In combination with improved wafer-scale CVD growth of 2D materials, this approach provides a promising route towards scalable quantum photonic chips.\\n        ',\n",

This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large ($N \\\\gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz) speeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and image-classification reveal a \"standard quantum limit\" for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of ultra-low-energy processors for deep learning.\\n        ',\n",

Here we report on the spin and optical properties of individual tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond nanostructures. Through cryogenic magneto-optical and spin spectroscopy, we verify the inversion-symmetric electronic structure of the SnV, identify spin-conserving and spin-flipping transitions, characterize transition linewidths, measure electron spin lifetimes and evaluate the spin dephasing time. We find that the optical transitions are consistent with the radiative lifetime limit even in nanofabricated structures. The spin lifetime is phononlimited with an exponential temperature scaling leading to $T_1$ $>$ 10 ms, and the coherence time, $T_2$ reaches the nuclear spin-bath limit upon cooling to 2.9 K. These spin properties exceed those of other inversion-symmetric color centers for which similar values require millikelvin temperatures. With a combination of coherent optical transitions and long spin coherence without dilution refrigeration, the SnV is a promising candidate for feasable and scalable quantum networking applications.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Large-scale quantum technologies require exquisite control over many individual quantum systems. Typically, such systems are very sensitive to environmental fluctuations, and diagnosing errors via measurements causes unavoidable perturbations. In this work we present an in situ frequency locking technique that monitors and corrects frequency variations in single photon sources based on microring resonators. By using the same classical laser fields required for photon generation as a probe to diagnose variations in the resonator frequency, our protocol applies feedback control to correct photon frequency errors in parallel to the optical quantum computation without disturbing the physical qubit. We implement our technique on a silicon photonic device and demonstrate sub 1 pm frequency stabilization in the presence of applied environmental noise, corresponding to a fractional frequency drift of <1 % of a photon linewidth. Using these methods we demonstrate feedback controlled quantum state engineering. By distributing a single local oscillator across a single chip or network of chips, our approach enables frequency locking of many single photon sources for large-scale photonic quantum technologies.\\n        ',\n",

There has been much effort recently toward developing novel, application-specific hardware, across many different fields of engineering, such as integrated circuits, memristors, and photonics. However, unleashing the true potential of such novel architectures requires the development of featured algorithms which optimally exploit their fundamental properties. We here present the Photonic Recurrent Ising Sampler (PRIS), a heuristic method tailored for parallel architectures that allows for fast and efficient sampling from distributions of combinatorially hard Ising problems. Since the PRIS relies essentially on vector-to-fixed matrix multiplications, we suggest the implementation of the PRIS in photonic parallel networks, which realize these operations at an unprecedented speed. The PRIS provides sample solutions to the ground state of arbitrary Ising models, by converging in probability to their associated Gibbs distribution. By running the PRIS at various noise levels, we probe the critical behavior of universality classes and their critical exponents. In addition to the attractive features of photonic networks, the PRIS relies on intrinsic dynamic noise and eigenvalue dropout to find ground states more efficiently. Our work suggests speedups in heuristic methods via photonic implementations of the PRIS. We also hint at a broader class of (meta)heuristic algorithms derived from the PRIS, such as combined simulated annealing on the noise and eigenvalue dropout levels. Our algorithm can also be implemented in a competitive manner on fast parallel electronic hardware, such as FPGAs and ASICs.\\n        ',\n",

Here, we show that cascaded two-cavity system can further improve the photon characteristics and greatly reduce the Q-factor requirement to levels achievable with present-day technology. Our approach leverages recent advances in nanocavities with ultrasmall mode volume and does not require ultrafast excitation of the emitter.

Through numerical simulation and analysis we train the QONN to perform a range of quantum information processing tasks, including newly developed protocols for quantum optical state compression, reinforcement learning, and black-box quantum simulation. We consistently demonstrate our system can generalize from only a small set of training data onto states for which it has not been trained.

First-principles calculations predict a negatively-charged Pb-vacancy center in a split-vacancy configuration, with a zero-phonon transition around 2.3 eV. Cryogenic photoluminescence measurements performed on emitters in nanofabricated pillars reveal several transitions, including a prominent doublet near 520 nm. The splitting of this doublet, 2 THz, exceeds that reported for other group-IV centers.

Magnetic coupling in particular is attractive for efficient and deterministic entanglement gates, but raises the problem of individual spin addressing at the necessary nanometer-scale separation. Current super-resolution techniques can reach this resolution, but are destructive to the states of nearby qubits. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of individual qubit states in a sub-diffraction cluster by selectively exciting spectrally distinguishable nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate super-resolution localization of single centers with nanometer spatial resolution, as well as individual control and readout of spin populations. These measurements indicate a readout-induced crosstalk on non-addressed qubits below $4\\\\times10^{-2}$.

Stellar population and dust maps are constructed from the high-resolution CANDELS/3D-HST multi-band imaging. Rather than constructing the layout of resolved elements (i.e., Voronoi bins) from the S/N distribution of the $H_{160}$-band alone, we introduce a modified Voronoi binning method that additionally incorporates the S/N distribution of several resolved filters. The SED-derived resolved E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$, stellar population ages, SFRs, and stellar masses that are inferred from the Voronoi bins constructed from multiple filters are generally consistent with the properties inferred from the integrated photometry within the uncertainties, with the exception of the inferred E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$ from our $z\\\\sim1.5$ sample due to their UV slopes being unconstrained by the resolved photometry. The results from our multi-filter Voronoi binning technique are compared to those derived from a \"traditional\" single-filter Voronoi binning approach. We find that single-filter binning produces inferred E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$ that are systematically redder by 0.02 mag on average, but could differ by up to 0.20 mag, and could be attributed to poorly constrained resolved photometry covering the UV slope. Overall, we advocate that our methodology produces more reliable SED-derived parameters due to the best-fit resolved SEDs being better constrained at all resolved wavelengths--particularly those covering the UV slope.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We present results from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on broad flux from the nebular emission lines H$Œ±$, [NII], [OIII], H$Œ≤$, and [SII]. The sample consists of 127 star-forming galaxies at $1.37 < z < 2.61$ and 84 galaxies at $2.95 < z < 3.80$. We decompose the emission lines using narrow ($\\\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$) and broad ($\\\\text{FWHM} > 300 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$) Gaussian components for individual galaxies and stacks. Broad emission is detected at $>3œÉ$ in $<10$% of galaxies and the broad flux accounts for 10-70% of the total flux. We find a slight increase in broad to narrow flux ratio with mass but note that we cannot reliably detect broad emission with $\\\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$, which may be significant at low masses. Notably, there is a correlation between higher signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra and a broad component detection indicating a S/N dependence in our ability to detect broad flux. When placed on the N2-BPT diagram ([OIII]/H$Œ≤$ vs. [NII]/H$Œ±$) the broad components of the stacks are shifted towards higher [OIII]/H$Œ≤$ and [NII]/$Œ±$ ratios compared to the narrow component. We compare the location of the broad components to shock models and find that the broad component could be due to shocks, but we do not rule out other possibilities such as the presence of an AGN. We estimate the mass loading factor (mass outflow rate/star formation rate) assuming the broad component is a photoionized outflow and find that the mass loading factor increases as a function of mass which agrees with previous studies. We show that adding emission from shocked gas to $z\\\\sim0$ SDSS spectra shifts galaxies towards the location of $z\\\\sim2$ galaxies on several emission line diagnostic diagrams.\\n        ',\n",

The AGN have bolometric luminosities of $\\\\sim10^{44}-10^{46} ~\\\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, including both quasars and moderate-luminosity AGN.

The outflow velocities span $\\\\sim$300 to 1000 km s$^{-1}$. Eight of the 13 outflows are spatially extended on similar scales as the host galaxies, with spatial extents of 2.5 to 11.0 kpc. Outflows are detected uniformly across the star-forming main sequence, showing little trend with the host galaxy SFR. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that the outflowing gas is photoionized by the AGN. We do not find evidence for positive AGN feedback, in either our small MOSDEF sample or a much larger SDSS sample, using the BPT diagram. Given that a galaxy with an AGN is ten times more likely to have a detected outflow, the outflowing gas is photoionzed by the AGN, and estimates of the mass and energy outflow rates indicate that stellar feedback is insufficient to drive at least some of these outflows, they are very likely to be AGN-driven. The outflows have mass-loading factors of the order of unity, suggesting that they help regulate star formation in their host galaxies, though they may be insufficient to fully quench it.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We present results on the variation of 7.7 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z ~ 2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~ 2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\\\\odot}$, compared to the more massive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24 micron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more than a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\\\\odot}$. We adopt a mass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22 for $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\\\\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new scaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived.

These surface cues, as the ``shortcuts'' inherent in the datasets, do not contribute to the *task-specific information* (TSI) of the classification tasks. While it is essential to look at the model performance, it is also important to understand the datasets. In this paper, we consider this question: Apart from the information introduced by the shortcut features, how much task-specific information is required to classify a dataset? We formulate this quantity in an information-theoretic framework. While this quantity is hard to compute, we approximate it with a fast and stable method. TSI quantifies the amount of linguistic knowledge modulo a set of predefined shortcuts -- that contributes to classifying a sample from each dataset. This framework allows us to compare across datasets, saying that, apart from a set of ``shortcut features'', classifying each sample in the Multi-NLI task involves around 0.4 nats more TSI than in the Quora Question Pair.\\n        \",\n",

We focus on the condition of patients in the intensive care unit, where a ``medical dead-end'' indicates that a patient will expire, regardless of all potential future treatment sequences. We postulate ``treatment security'' as avoiding treatments with probability proportional to their chance of leading to dead-ends, present a formal proof, and frame discovery as an RL problem.

       " '\\n        Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance on many supervised learning tasks. However, prior evidence suggests that these models may learn to rely on shortcut biases or spurious correlations (intuitively, correlations that do not hold in the test as they hold in train) for good predictive performance. Such models cannot be trusted in deployment environments to provide accurate predictions. While viewing the problem from a causal lens is known to be useful, the seamless integration of causation techniques into machine learning pipelines remains cumbersome and expensive. In this work, we study and extend a causal pre-training debiasing technique called causal bootstrapping (CB) under five practical confounded-data generation-acquisition scenarios (with known and unknown confounding). Under these settings, we systematically investigate the effect of confounding bias on deep learning model performance, demonstrating their propensity to rely on shortcut biases when these biases are not properly accounted for. We demonstrate that such a causal pre-training technique can significantly outperform existing base practices to mitigate confounding bias on real-world domain generalization benchmarking tasks. This systematic investigation underlines the importance of accounting for the underlying data-generating mechanisms and fortifying data-preprocessing pipelines with a causal framework to develop methods robust to confounding biases.\\n        ',\n",

We conduct a large-scale empirical study of DRO and several variations of standard learning procedures to identify approaches for model development and selection that consistently improve disaggregated and worst-case performance over subpopulations compared to standard approaches for learning predictive models from electronic health records data. In the course of our evaluation, we introduce an extension to DRO approaches that allows for specification of the metric used to assess worst-case performance. We conduct the analysis for models that predict in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day readmission for inpatient admissions, and predict in-hospital mortality using intensive care data. We find that, with relatively few exceptions, no approach performs better, for each patient subpopulation examined, than standard learning procedures using the entire training dataset. These results imply that when it is of interest to improve model performance for patient subpopulations beyond what can be achieved with standard practices, it may be necessary to do so via techniques that implicitly or explicitly increase the effective sample size.\\n        ',\n",

Our findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race, such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further study.\\n  Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model has access to.\\n        ',\n",

We find that while generalization tends to consistently degrade with difficulty, some methods are better at retaining performance as the distribution shift increases. Finally, we propose few-shot DML as an efficient way to consistently improve generalization in response to unknown test shifts presented in ooDML.

Recent developments in domain generalization offer a promising solution to this problem by creating models that learn invariances across environments. In this work, we benchmark the performance of eight domain generalization methods on multi-site clinical time series and medical imaging data. We introduce a framework to induce synthetic but realistic domain shifts and sampling bias to stress-test these methods over existing non-healthcare benchmarks. We find that current domain generalization methods do not consistently achieve significant gains in out-of-distribution performance over empirical risk minimization on real-world medical imaging data, in line with prior work on general imaging datasets. However, a subset of realistic induced-shift scenarios in clinical time series data do exhibit limited performance gains. We characterize these scenarios in detail, and recommend best practices for domain generalization in the clinical setting.\\n        ',\n",

In practice, successful RL relies on informative latent states derived from sequential observations to develop optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to representation learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial nature of healthcare data.\\n        ',\n",

While much work has targeted treatment effect estimation from observational data, there is relatively little work in the setting of confounding variable missingness, where collecting more information on confounders is often costly or time-consuming. In this work, we frame this challenge as a problem of feature acquisition of confounding features for causal inference. Our goal is to prioritize acquiring values for a fixed and known subset of missing confounders in samples that lead to efficient average treatment effect estimation. We propose two acquisition strategies based on i) covariate balancing (CB), and ii) reducing statistical estimation error on observed factual outcome error (OE). We compare CB and OE on five common causal effect estimation methods, and demonstrate improved sample efficiency of OE over baseline methods under various settings.

Previous approaches used limited context length Word2Vec embeddings and keyword searches to predict scores given a consult note, but often failed when scores were not explicitly stated. In this work, we present MS-BERT, the first publicly available transformer model trained on real clinical data other than MIMIC.

In such settings, methods for differentially private (DP) learning provide a general-purpose approach to learn models with privacy guarantees.

The resulting privacy-preserving models, therefore, neglect information from the tails of a data distribution, resulting in a loss of accuracy that can disproportionately affect small groups. In this paper, we study the effects of DP learning in health care. We use state-of-the-art methods for DP learning to train privacy-preserving models in clinical prediction tasks, including x-ray classification of images and mortality prediction in time series data. We use these models to perform a comprehensive empirical investigation of the tradeoffs between privacy, utility, robustness to dataset shift, and fairness. Our results highlight lesser-known limitations of methods for DP learning in health care, models that exhibit steep tradeoffs between privacy and utility, and models whose predictions are disproportionately influenced by large demographic groups in the training data.

We find that while MTL does suffer from common negative transfer, we can realize significant gains via MTL pre-training combined with single-task fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these gains can be achieved in a task-independent manner and offer not only minor improvements under traditional learning, but also notable gains in a few-shot learning context, thereby suggesting this could be a scalable vehicle to offer improved performance in important healthcare contexts.\\n        ',\n",

It is therefore crucial to understand what makes for good, transfer-able features in deep networks that best allow for such adaptation. In this paper, we shed light on this by showing that features that are most transferable have high uniformity in the embedding space and propose a uniformity regularization scheme that encourages better transfer and feature reuse. We evaluate the regularization on its ability to facilitate adaptation to unseen tasks and data, for which we conduct a thorough experimental study covering four relevant, and distinct domains: few-shot Meta-Learning, Deep Metric Learning, Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation, as well as Out-of-Distribution classification.

To circumvent this, one may build rule-based or other expert-knowledge driven labelers to ingest data and yield silver labels absent any ground-truth training data. One popular such labeler is CheXpert, a labeler that produces diagnostic labels for chest X-ray radiology reports. CheXpert is very useful, but is relatively computationally slow, especially when integrated with end-to-end neural pipelines, is non-differentiable so can't be used in any applications that require gradients to flow through the labeler, and does not yield probabilistic outputs, which limits our ability to improve the quality of the silver labeler through techniques such as active learning.\\n  In this work, we solve all three of these problems with $\\\\texttt{CheXpert++}$, a BERT-based, high-fidelity approximation to CheXpert. $\\\\texttt{CheXpert++}$ achieves 99.81\\\\% parity with CheXpert, which means it can be reliably used as a drop-in replacement for CheXpert, all while being significantly faster, fully differentiable, and probabilistic in output. Error analysis of $\\\\texttt{CheXpert++}$ also demonstrates that $\\\\texttt{CheXpert++}$ has a tendency to actually correct errors in the CheXpert labels, with $\\\\texttt{CheXpert++}$ labels being more often preferred by a clinician over CheXpert labels (when they disagree) on all but one disease task. To further demonstrate the utility of these advantages in this model, we conduct a proof-of-concept active learning study, demonstrating we can improve accuracy on an expert labeled random subset of report sentences by approximately 8\\\\% over raw, unaltered CheXpert by using one-iteration of active-learning inspired re-training.

We demonstrate how this addresses data-scarcity in the presence of unobserved confounding. The causal parametrization of our sampling procedure guarantees that counterfactual quantities can be estimated from scarce observational target data, maintaining intuitive stability properties. Policy learning in the target domain is further regularized via the source policy through KL-divergence. Through evaluation on a simulated sepsis treatment task, our counterfactual policy transfer procedure significantly improves the performance of a learned treatment policy when assumptions of \"no-unobserved confounding\" are relaxed.\\n        ',\n",

This task is complicated by data sources that are noisy, sparse, heterogeneous and outcomes that are imbalanced. In this paper, we integrate data from all available ICU sources (vitals, labs, notes, demographics) and focus on learning rich representations of this data to predict onset and weaning of multiple invasive interventions. In particular, we compare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable \"real-time\" performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results on our predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines in intervention prediction, and provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for the adoption of such models in practice.\\n        ',\n",

In particular, privacy concerns have led to a dearth of public datasets, complicated the construction of multi-hospital cohorts and limited the utilization of external machine learning resources. To remedy this, new methods are required to enable data owners, such as hospitals, to share their datasets publicly, while preserving both patient privacy and modeling utility. We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme based on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using a randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and publishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich family of encoding functions offers a well-defined and meaningful notion of privacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of the underlying data-distribution. We propose to approximate this family of encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks and show that NeuraCrypt achieves competitive accuracy to non-private baselines on a variety of x-ray tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that multiple hospitals, using independent private encoders, can collaborate to train improved x-ray models. Finally, we release a challenge dataset to encourage the development of new attacks on NeuraCrypt.\\n        ',\n",

While cost-effective most of the time, this sharing can cause undesired interference among seemingly independent traffic. As a result, low-priority traffic can cause increased packet loss to high-priority traffic. Similarly, long flows can prevent the buffer from absorbing incoming bursts even if they do not share the same queue. The cause of this perhaps unintuitive outcome is that today's buffer sharing techniques are unable to guarantee isolation across (priority) queues without statically allocating buffer space. To address this issue, we designed FB, a novel buffer sharing scheme that offers strict isolation guarantees to high-priority traffic without sacrificing link utilizations. Thus, FB outperforms conventional buffer sharing algorithms in absorbing bursts while achieving on-par throughput. We show that FB is practical and runs at line-rate on existing hardware (Barefoot Tofino). Significantly, FB's operations can be approximated in non-programmable devices.\\n        \",\n",

Starting from a pre-trained network, the process is as follows: remove redundant parameters, retrain, and repeat while maintaining the same test accuracy. The result is a model that is a fraction of the size of the original with comparable predictive performance (test accuracy). Here, we reassess and evaluate whether the use of test accuracy alone in the terminating condition is sufficient to ensure that the resulting model performs well across a wide spectrum of \"harder\" metrics such as generalization to out-of-distribution data and resilience to noise. Across evaluations on varying architectures and data sets, we find that pruned networks effectively approximate the unpruned model, however, the prune ratio at which pruned networks achieve commensurate performance varies significantly across tasks.

We find that high scoring convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on popular benchmarks exhibit troubling pathologies that allow them to display high accuracy even in the absence of semantically salient features. When a model provides a high-confidence decision without salient supporting input features, we say the classifier has overinterpreted its input, finding too much class-evidence in patterns that appear nonsensical to humans. Here, we demonstrate that neural networks trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet suffer from overinterpretation, and we find models on CIFAR-10 make confident predictions even when 95% of input images are masked and humans cannot discern salient features in the remaining pixel-subsets. We introduce Batched Gradient SIS, a new method for discovering sufficient input subsets for complex datasets, and use this method to show the sufficiency of border pixels in ImageNet for training and testing. Although these patterns portend potential model fragility in real-world deployment, they are in fact valid statistical patterns of the benchmark that alone suffice to attain high test accuracy. Unlike adversarial examples, overinterpretation relies upon unmodified image pixels. We find ensembling and input dropout can each help mitigate overinterpretation.\\n        ',\n",

Here we describe Maximize Overall Diversity (MOD), a straightforward approach to improve ensemble-based uncertainty estimates by encouraging larger overall diversity in ensemble predictions across all possible inputs that might be encountered in the future. When applied to various neural network ensembles, MOD significantly improves predictive performance for out-of-distribution test examples without sacrificing in-distribution performance on 38 Protein-DNA binding regression datasets, 9 UCI datasets, and the IMDB-Wiki image dataset.

This work is motivated by the recent rise of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments over a brief time course, which aim to identify genes relevant to the progression of a particular biological process across diverse cell populations. While classical statistical tools focus on scalar-response regression or order-agnostic differences between distributions, it is desirable in this setting to consider both the full distributions as well as the structure imposed by their ordering. We introduce a new regression model for ordinal covariates where responses are univariate distributions and the underlying relationship reflects consistent changes in the distributions over increasing levels of the covariate. This concept is formalized as a \"trend\" in distributions, which we define as an evolution that is linear under the Wasserstein metric.

Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data.

This limitation prevents the analysis of millions of MRI scans acquired with large inter-slice spacing (\"thick slice\") in clinical settings every year. The inability to quantitatively analyze these scans hinders the adoption of quantitative neuroimaging in healthcare, and precludes research studies that could attain huge sample sizes and hence greatly improve our understanding of the human brain. Recent advances in CNNs are producing outstanding results in super-resolution and contrast synthesis of MRI. However, these approaches are very sensitive to the contrast, resolution and orientation of the input images, and thus do not generalize to diverse clinical acquisition protocols - even within sites. Here we present SynthSR, a method to train a CNN that receives one or more thick-slice scans with different contrast, resolution and orientation, and produces an isotropic scan of canonical contrast (typically a 1 mm MP-RAGE). The presented method does not require any preprocessing, e.g., skull stripping or bias field correction. Crucially, SynthSR trains on synthetic input images generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrasts, resolutions and orientations without high-resolution training data. We test the images generated with SynthSR in an array of common downstream analyses, and show that they can be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration (e.g., for tensor-based morphometry), and, if some image quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.

We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and reconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image. We further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions.

The variance is chosen to maximize the log-likelihood of the ensemble average ($\\\\mathbb{L}$) on the validation data set. Empirically, and perhaps surprisingly, $\\\\mathbb{L}$ has a well-defined maximum as the variance grows from zero (which corresponds to the baseline model). Conveniently, calibration level of predictions also tends to grow favorably until the peak of $\\\\mathbb{L}$ is reached. In most experiments, PEP provides a small improvement in performance, and, in some cases, a substantial improvement in empirical calibration. We show that this \"PEP effect\" (the gain in log-likelihood) is related to the mean curvature of the likelihood function and the empirical Fisher information. Experiments on ImageNet pre-trained networks including ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception showed improved calibration and likelihood. We further observed a mild improvement in classification accuracy on these networks. Experiments on classification benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 showed improved calibration and likelihood, as well as the relationship between the PEP effect and overfitting; this demonstrates that PEP can be used to probe the level of overfitting that occurred during training.

Our approach is based on training a classifier that provides the probability that a data sample pair is drawn from the joint distribution rather than from the product of its marginal distributions. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between mutual information and the average log odds estimate produced by the classifier on a test set, leading to a simple and accurate estimator of mutual information.

Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure.

       " '\\n        We demonstrate that neural network layers that explicitly combine frequency and image feature representations are a versatile building block for analysis of imaging data acquired in the frequency space. Our work is motivated by the challenges arising in MRI acquisition where the signal is a corrupted Fourier transform of the desired image. The joint learning schemes proposed and analyzed in this paper enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that apply learned data manipulations solely in the frequency space or solely in the image space. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning on three diverse tasks: image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, motion correction, and image denoising in brain and knee MRI. We further demonstrate advantages of the joint learning approaches across training schemes using a wide variety of loss functions. Unlike purely image based and purely frequency based architectures, the joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. Joint image and frequency space feature representations promise to significantly improve modeling and reconstruction of images acquired in the frequency space.

The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 200,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6\\\\% and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed method is also implemented and evaluated on an MR scanner, which demonstrates the feasibility of online image quality assessment and image reacquisition during fetal MR scans.\\n        ',\n",

To articulate a conceptual framework for research at the interface of brain sciences and computing and to identify key problems in this interface, presented in a way that will attract both CISE and brain researchers into this space. 2. To inform and excite researchers within the CISE research community about brain research opportunities and to identify and explain strategic roles they can play in advancing this initiative. 3.

Challenge participants were required to make a prediction, for each month of a 5-year future time period, of three key outcomes: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer\\'s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog13), and total volume of the ventricles. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume prediction, the best algorithms strongly outperform simple baselines in predictive ability. However, for ADAS-Cog13 no single submitted prediction method was significantly better than random guessing. Two ensemble methods based on taking the mean and median over all predictions, obtained top scores on almost all tasks. Better than average performance at diagnosis prediction was generally associated with the additional inclusion of features from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). On the other hand, better performance at ventricle volume prediction was associated with inclusion of summary statistics, such as patient-specific biomarker trends. The submission system remains open via the website https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org, while code for submissions is being collated by TADPOLE SHARE: https://tadpole-share.github.io/.

Participants are then required to make forecasts of three key outcomes for ADNI-3 rollover participants: clinical diagnosis, ADAS-Cog 13, and total volume of the ventricles -- which are then compared with future measurements. Strong points of the challenge are that the test data did not exist at the time of forecasting (it was acquired afterwards), and that it focuses on the challenging problem of cohort selection for clinical trials by identifying fast progressors. The submission phase of TADPOLE was open until 15 November 2017; since then data has been acquired until April 2019 from 219 subjects with 223 clinical visits and 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which was used for the evaluation of the participants' predictions. Thirty-three teams participated with a total of 92 submissions. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For diagnosis prediction, the best forecast (team Frog), which was based on gradient boosting, obtained a multiclass area under the receiver-operating curve (MAUC) of 0.931, while for ventricle prediction the best forecast (team EMC1), which was based on disease progression modelling and spline regression, obtained mean absolute error of 0.41% of total intracranial volume (ICV). For ADAS-Cog 13, no forecast was considerably better than the benchmark mixed effects model (BenchmarkME), provided to participants before the submission deadline.

The key idea is to employ a copula model to separate the joint dependency structure from the marginal distributions of variables of interest. This separation provides flexibility on the assumptions made during the modeling process. The proposed method can handle binary, discrete, ordinal and continuous variables. We demonstrate a simple and efficient way to include binary, discrete and ordinal variables into the modeling. We build Bayesian conditional models based on observed partial clinical indicators, features or shape based on Gaussian processes capturing the dependency structure. We apply the proposed method on a stroke dataset to jointly model the shape of the lateral ventricles, the spatial distribution of the white matter hyperintensity associated with periventricular white matter disease, and clinical indicators.

       " '\\n        The performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy is fundamentally constrained by fetal motion. Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10-30 minutes). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4\\\\% accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.\\n        ',\n",

Compared to existing visualisation software (i.e. Freesurfer, SPM, 3D Slicer), BrainPainter has three key advantages: (1) it does not require the input data to be in a specialised format, allowing BrainPainter to be used in combination with any neuroimaging analysis tools, (2) it can visualise both cortical and subcortical structures and (3) it can be used to generate movies showing dynamic processes, e.g. propagation of pathology on the brain. We highlight three use cases where BrainPainter was used in existing neuroimaging studies: (1) visualisation of the degree of atrophy through interpolation along a user-defined gradient of colours, (2) visualisation of the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease as well as (3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington's disease. Moreover, through the design of BrainPainter we demonstrate the possibility of using a powerful 3D computer graphics engine such as Blender to generate brain visualisations for the neuroscience community. Blender's capabilities, e.g. particle simulations, motion graphics, UV unwrapping, raster graphics editing, raytracing and illumination effects, open a wealth of possibilities for brain visualisation not available in current neuroimaging software.

       " '\\n        Probabilistic atlas priors have been commonly used to derive adaptive and robust brain MRI segmentation algorithms. Widely-used neuroimage analysis pipelines rely heavily on these techniques, which are often computationally expensive. In contrast, there has been a recent surge of approaches that leverage deep learning to implement segmentation tools that are computationally efficient at test time. However, most of these strategies rely on learning from manually annotated images. These supervised deep learning methods are therefore sensitive to the intensity profiles in the training dataset. To develop a deep learning-based segmentation model for a new image dataset (e.g., of different contrast), one usually needs to create a new labeled training dataset, which can be prohibitively expensive, or rely on suboptimal ad hoc adaptation or augmentation approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that combines a conventional probabilistic atlas-based segmentation with deep learning, enabling one to train a segmentation model for new MRI scans without the need for any manually segmented images. Our experiments include thousands of brain MRI scans and demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good accuracy for a brain MRI segmentation task for different MRI contrasts, requiring only approximately 15 seconds at test time on a GPU.

Monitoring placental function in vivo promises to support pregnancy assessment and to improve care outcomes. We aim to alleviate visualization and interpretation challenges presented by the shape of the placenta when it is attached to the curved uterine wall. To do so, we flatten the volumetric mesh that captures placental shape to resemble the well-studied ex vivo shape. We formulate our method as a map from the in vivo shape to a flattened template that minimizes the symmetric Dirichlet energy to control distortion throughout the volume. Local injectivity is enforced via constrained line search during gradient descent. We evaluate the proposed method on 28 placenta shapes extracted from MRI images in a clinical study of placental function. We achieve sub-voxel accuracy in mapping the boundary of the placenta to the template while successfully controlling distortion throughout the volume. We illustrate how the resulting mapping of the placenta enhances visualization of placental anatomy and function.

However, some brain structures (e.g., globus pallidus, thalamus and its nuclei) can be extracted more accurately by fusing the two modalities. Following the framework of Bayesian segmentation with probabilistic atlases and unsupervised appearance modeling, we present here a novel algorithm to jointly segment multi-modal sMRI/dMRI data. We propose a hierarchical likelihood term for the dMRI defined on the unit ball, which combines the Beta and Dimroth-Scheidegger-Watson distributions to model the data at each voxel. This term is integrated with a mixture of Gaussians for the sMRI data, such that the resulting joint unsupervised likelihood enables the analysis of multi-modal scans acquired with any type of MRI contrast, b-values, or number of directions, which enables wide applicability. We also propose an inference algorithm to estimate the maximum-a-posteriori model parameters from input images, and to compute the most likely segmentation. Using a recently published atlas derived from histology, we apply our method to thalamic nuclei segmentation on two datasets: HCP (state of the art) and ADNI (legacy) - producing lower sample sizes than Bayesian segmentation with sMRI alone.\\n        ',\n",

Time-course analysis for in-utero volumetric MRI time series often suffers from substantial and unpredictable fetal motion. Registration provides voxel correspondences between images and is commonly employed for motion correction. Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero MRI time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps. Our results suggest that the proposed model captures accurately the temporal dynamics of transformations in in-utero MRI time series.\\n        ',\n",

Accurate assessment of pulmonary edema in heart failure is critical when making treatment and disposition decisions. Our work is grounded in a large-scale clinical dataset of over 300,000 x-ray images with associated radiology reports. While edema severity labels can be extracted unambiguously from a small fraction of the radiology reports, accurate annotation is challenging in most cases. To take advantage of the unlabeled images, we develop a Bayesian model that includes a variational auto-encoder for learning a latent representation from the entire image set trained jointly with a regressor that employs this representation for predicting pulmonary edema severity. Our experimental results suggest that modeling the distribution of images jointly with the limited labels improves the accuracy of pulmonary edema scoring compared to a strictly supervised approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ machine learning algorithms to automatically and quantitatively assess the severity of pulmonary edema in chest x-ray images.\\n        ',\n",

DKT infers robust multimodal biomarker trajectories in rare neurodegenerative diseases even when only limited, unimodal data is available, by transferring information from larger multimodal datasets from common neurodegenerative diseases. DKT is a joint-disease generative model of biomarker progressions, which exploits biomarker relationships that are shared across diseases. Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the estimation of plausible, multimodal biomarker trajectories in Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a rare neurodegenerative disease where only unimodal MRI data is available. For this we train DKT on a combined dataset containing subjects with two distinct diseases and sizes of data available: 1) a larger, multimodal typical AD (tAD) dataset from the TADPOLE Challenge, and 2) a smaller unimodal Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) dataset from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), for which only a limited number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are available. Although validation is challenging due to lack of data in PCA, we validate DKT on synthetic data and two patient datasets (TADPOLE and PCA cohorts), showing it can estimate the ground truth parameters in the simulation and predict unseen biomarkers on the two patient datasets. While we demonstrated DKT on Alzheimer's variants, we note DKT is generalisable to other forms of related neurodegenerative diseases.

A common approach is to train a model to directly segment an image, requiring a large collection of manually annotated images to capture the anatomical variability in a cohort. In contrast, we develop a segmentation model that recursively evolves a segmentation in several steps, and implement it as a recurrent neural network. We learn model parameters by optimizing the interme- diate steps of the evolution in addition to the final segmentation. To this end, we train our segmentation propagation model by presenting incom- plete and/or inaccurate input segmentations paired with a recommended next step. Our work aims to alleviate challenges in segmenting heart structures from cardiac MRI for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), which encompasses a range of morphological deformations and topological changes. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach on a dataset of 20 images from CHD patients, learning a model that accurately segments individual heart chambers and great vessels. Com- pared to direct segmentation, the iterative method yields more accurate segmentation for patients with the most severe CHD malformations.\\n        ',\n",

Although large data sets of clinical images contain a wealth of information, time constraints during acquisition result in sparse scans that fail to capture much of the anatomy. These characteristics often render computational analysis impractical as many image analysis algorithms tend to fail when applied to such images. Highly specialized algorithms that explicitly handle sparse slice spacing do not generalize well across problem domains. In contrast, we aim to enable application of existing algorithms that were originally developed for high resolution research scans to significantly undersampled scans. We introduce a generative model that captures fine-scale anatomical structure across subjects in clinical image collections and derive an algorithm for filling in the missing data in scans with large inter-slice spacing. Our experimental results demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms state-of-the-art upsampling super-resolution techniques, and promises to facilitate subsequent analysis not previously possible with scans of this quality.

The keypoint transfer algorithm includes three steps: (i) keypoint matching, (ii) voting-based keypoint labeling, and (iii) keypoint-based probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations. We report segmentation results for abdominal organs in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method offers a speed-up of about three orders of magnitude in comparison to common multi-atlas segmentation, while achieving an accuracy that compares favorably. Moreover, keypoint transfer does not require the registration to an atlas or a training phase.

Developing such a registration method is very challenging, due to factors such as missing correspondence in images, the complexity of brain pathology and the demand for fast computation. We propose a novel feature-driven active framework. Here, landmarks and their displacement are first estimated from a pair of US images using corresponding local image features. Subsequently, a Gaussian Process (GP) model is used to interpolate a dense deformation field from the sparse landmarks. Kernels of the GP are estimated by using variograms and a discrete grid search method. If necessary, the user can actively add new landmarks based on the image context and visualization of the uncertainty measure provided by the GP to further improve the result.

Our analysis relies on a new local property for how similar nearby patches are, and fuses existing lines of work on modeling natural imagery patches and theory for nonparametric classification. We use the model to derive a new patch-based segmentation algorithm that iterates between inferring local label patches and merging these local segmentations to produce a globally consistent image segmentation.

A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nystr√∂m method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds.

We subsequently show how this variational DPP approximation generalizes and extends mean-field approximation, and can be learned efficiently by exploiting the fast sampling properties of DPPs. Our motivating application comes from bioinformatics, where we aim to identify a diverse set of genes whose expression profiles predict a tumor type where the diversity is defined with respect to a gene-gene interaction network. We also explore an application in spatial statistics. In both cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields significantly more diverse feature sets than classic sparse methods, without compromising accuracy.\\n        ',\n",

Its use in real-time applications requires fast projection onto the low-dimensional space. To this end, out-of-sample extensions are applied by constructing an interpolation function that maps from the input space to the low-dimensional manifold. Commonly used approaches such as the Nystr√∂m extension and kernel ridge regression require using all training points. We propose an interpolation function that only depends on a small subset of the input training data. Consequently, in the testing phase each new point only needs to be compared against a small number of input training data in order to project the point onto the low-dimensional space. We interpret our method as an out-of-sample extension that approximates kernel ridge regression. Our method involves solving a simple convex optimization problem and has the attractive property of guaranteeing an upper bound on the approximation error, which is crucial for medical applications. Tuning this error bound controls the sparsity of the resulting interpolation function. We illustrate our method in two clinical applications that require fast mapping of input images onto a low-dimensional space.\\n        ',\n",

       " '\\n        We present HyperMorph, a learning-based strategy for deformable image registration that removes the need to tune important registration hyperparameters during training. Classical registration methods solve an optimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two images, while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a function that generates these correspondences. The quality of the results for both types of techniques depends greatly on the choice of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically involves training many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially leading to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce amortized hyperparameter learning for image registration, a novel strategy to learn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation fields. The proposed framework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and modulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for that hyperparameter value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model that enables rapid, fine-grained discovery of hyperparameter values from a continuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search strategies, leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as increased flexibility. We also show several important benefits, including increased robustness to initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a registration task, dataset, or even a single anatomical region, all without retraining the HyperMorph model.

Image analysis presents a major bottleneck in this pipeline since the parasite has significant variability in size, shape, and density in these models. As with other highly variable datasets, traditional segmentation models have poor generalizability as they rely on hand-crafted features; thus, manual annotation of liver stage malaria images remains standard. To address this need, we develop a convolutional neural network architecture that utilizes spatial dropout sampling for parasite segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation in images of liver stage malaria. Our pipeline produces high-precision segmentations nearly identical to expert annotations, generalizes well on a diverse dataset of liver stage malaria parasites, and promotes independence between learned feature maps to model the uncertainty of generated predictions.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Estimation of individual treatment effects is commonly used as the basis for contextual decision making in fields such as healthcare, education, and economics. However, it is often sufficient for the decision maker to have estimates of upper and lower bounds on the potential outcomes of decision alternatives to assess risks and benefits. We show that, in such cases, we can improve sample efficiency by estimating simple functions that bound these outcomes instead of estimating their conditional expectations, which may be complex and hard to estimate. Our analysis highlights a trade-off between the complexity of the learning task and the confidence with which the learned bounds hold. Guided by these findings, we develop an algorithm for learning upper and lower bounds on potential outcomes which optimize an objective function defined by the decision maker, subject to the probability that bounds are violated being small. Using a clinical dataset and a well-known causality benchmark, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines, providing tighter, more reliable bounds.\\n        ',\n",

Conventional methods for template creation and image alignment to the template have undergone decades of rich technical development. In these frameworks, templates are constructed using an iterative process of template estimation and alignment, which is often computationally very expensive. Due in part to this shortcoming, most methods compute a single template for the entire population of images, or a few templates for specific sub-groups of the data. In this work, we present a probabilistic model and efficient learning strategy that yields either universal or conditional templates, jointly with a neural network that provides efficient alignment of the images to these templates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on a variety of domains, with a special focus on neuroimaging. This is particularly useful for clinical applications where a pre-existing template does not exist, or creating a new one with traditional methods can be prohibitively expensive.

Lower quality reduces the data's utility, but smaller size enables both reduced network and storage costs at the servers and reduced power consumption in sensing devices. A natural solution is to compress the data at the sensing devices. Unfortunately, existing compression algorithms either violate the memory and latency constraints common for these devices or, as we show experimentally, perform poorly on sensor-generated time series.\\n  We introduce a time series compression algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while requiring less than 1KB of memory and adding virtually no latency.

To mitigate this risk, we introduce an approach that balances optimization of the primary reward function with preservation of the ability to optimize auxiliary reward functions.

A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some settings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse.

Thus we can actively select queries for maximum informativeness about the true reward. In contrast to approaches asking the designer for optimal behavior, this allows us to gather additional information by eliciting preferences between suboptimal behaviors. After each query, we need to update the posterior over the true reward function from observing the proxy reward function chosen by the designer.

In this work, we exploit a specific property of CIRL---the human is a full information agent---to derive an optimality-preserving modification to the standard Bellman update; this reduces the complexity of the problem by an exponential factor and allows us to relax CIRL's assumption of human rationality. We apply this update to a variety of POMDP solvers and find that it enables us to scale CIRL to non-trivial problems, with larger reward parameter spaces, and larger action spaces for both robot and human.

We conduct user studies in an abstract grid world domain and in a motion planning domain for a 7-DOF manipulator that measure user effort and solution quality. We show that our method is faster, easier to use, and produces a higher quality solution than the typical method of designing a reward jointly across all environments. We additionally conduct a series of experiments that measure the sensitivity of these results to different properties of the reward design task, such as the number of environments, the number of feasible solutions per environment, and the fraction of the total features that vary within each environment. We find that independent reward design outperforms the standard, joint, reward design process but works best when the design problem can be divided into simpler subproblems.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We suggest that the analysis of incomplete contracting developed by law and economics researchers can provide a useful framework for understanding the AI alignment problem and help to generate a systematic approach to finding solutions. We first provide an overview of the incomplete contracting literature and explore parallels between this work and the problem of AI alignment. As we emphasize, misalignment between principal and agent is a core focus of economic analysis. We highlight some technical results from the economics literature on incomplete contracts that may provide insights for AI alignment researchers. Our core contribution, however, is to bring to bear an insight that economists have been urged to absorb from legal scholars and other behavioral scientists: the fact that human contracting is supported by substantial amounts of external structure, such as generally available institutions (culture, law) that can supply implied terms to fill the gaps in incomplete contracts. We propose a research agenda for AI alignment work that focuses on the problem of how to build AI that can replicate the human cognitive processes that connect individual incomplete contracts with this supporting external structure.\\n        ',\n",

We start by investigating what types of states motion timing is capable of expressing, focusing on robot manipulation and keeping the path constant while systematically varying the timing. We find that users naturally pick up on certain properties of the robot (like confidence), of the motion (like naturalness), or of the task (like the weight of the object that the robot is carrying). We then conduct a hypothesis-driven experiment to tease out the directions and magnitudes of these effects, and use our findings to develop candidate mathematical models for how users make these inferences from the timing. We find a strong correlation between the models and real user data, suggesting that robots can leverage these models to autonomously optimize the timing of their motion to be expressive.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        Autonomous agents optimize the reward function we give them. What they don't know is how hard it is for us to design a reward function that actually captures what we want. When designing the reward, we might think of some specific training scenarios, and make sure that the reward will lead to the right behavior in those scenarios. Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce approximate methods for solving IRD problems, and use their solution to plan risk-averse behavior in test MDPs. Empirical results suggest that this approach can help alleviate negative side effects of misspecified reward functions and mitigate reward hacking.\\n        \",\n",

In robotics, value alignment is key to the design of collaborative robots that can integrate into human workflows, successfully inferring and adapting to their users' objectives as they go. We argue that a meaningful solution to value alignment must combine multi-agent decision theory with rich mathematical models of human cognition, enabling robots to tap into people's natural collaborative capabilities. We present a solution to the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) dynamic game based on well-established cognitive models of decision making and theory of mind. The solution captures a key reciprocity relation: the human will not plan her actions in isolation, but rather reason pedagogically about how the robot might learn from them; the robot, in turn, can anticipate this and interpret the human's actions pragmatically. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first formal analysis of value alignment grounded in empirically validated cognitive models.\\n        \",\n",

But, we humans are not perfect and we may give orders that are not best aligned to our preferences. We show that when a human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act according to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than a robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its owner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers the human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of obedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot has a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the level of rationality of the human. Finally, we study how robots can start detecting such model misspecification. Overall, our work suggests that there might be a middle ground in which robots intelligently decide when to obey human orders, but err on the side of obedience.\\n        \",\n",
       " \"\\n        It is clear that one of the primary tools we can use to mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.\\n        \",\n",

We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.\\n        \",\n",

Within this model there appears a term in which lattice vibrations are coupled to internal nuclear transitions. This is interesting as it has the potential to provide a connection between experiment and models that describe coherent energy transfer between two-level systems and an oscillator. In this work we describe a calculation of the coupling matrix element in the case of the deuteron based on the old empirical Hamada-Johnston model for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The triplet S and D states of the the deuteron in the rest frame couples to a singlet P state through this new interaction.

Since it may be possible that the lattice will respond to the mass change associated with a excited nuclear state, we adopt a relativistic description throughout based on a many-particle Dirac formalism. This approach has not been used in the past, perhaps due to the difficulty in separating the center of mass and relative degrees of freedom of the nuclear system, or perhaps due to an absence of applications for such a model. In response to some recent ideas about how to think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite momentum. This new effect comes about because of changes in the composite nuclear state as a result of the dynamical Lorentz boost in the lattice.\\n        ',\n",

However, the many-particle Dirac model is not manifestly covariant, and some other approach is required. We have found a simple approach that allows for a separation of relative and center of mass contributions to the energy. We are able to define the associated kinematic energy and determine the energy-momentum relation.

This problem has become of interest in connection with claims of observations of anomalies in metal deuterides. If the strong force interaction were dependent only on position (and not spin or isospin), then the coupling with phonons can be developed directly. Since a nuclear interaction can change the lattice constituents, the initial and final state lattices can be different, and we must include this in the formulation. For more realistic strong force models with spin and isospin dependence, we can use correlated nuclear wavefunctions which are made up of products of space, spin and isospin components. In this case, the spin and isospin algebra can be done analytically, producing channel-dependent potentials that are only space dependent. The formulation that results can be used for quantitative estimates of phonon exchange.\\n        ',\n",

Several insightful characteristics are revealed, including the diverse dynamics of co-ions and counter ions, replacement of co-ions by focused particles, lowered ion concentrations in particle enriched zone, and enhanced electroosmotic pumping effect etc. Conditions for particles that may be concentrated are identified in terms of charges, sizes and electrophoretic mobilities of particles and co-ions.

We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves >90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result.

However, due to the large quantum noises (errors), the performance of QNN models has a severe degradation on real quantum devices. For example, the accuracy gap between noise-free simulation and noisy results on IBMQ-Yorktown for MNIST-4 classification is over 60%. Existing noise mitigation methods are general ones without leveraging unique characteristics of QNN and are only applicable to inference; on the other hand, existing QNN work does not consider noise effect. To this end, we present RoQNN, a QNN-specific framework to perform noise-aware optimizations in both training and inference stages to improve robustness. We analytically deduct and experimentally observe that the effect of quantum noise to QNN measurement outcome is a linear map from noise-free outcome with a scaling and a shift factor. Motivated by that, we propose post-measurement normalization to mitigate the feature distribution differences between noise-free and noisy scenarios. Furthermore, to improve the robustness against noise, we propose noise injection to the training process by inserting quantum error gates to QNN according to realistic noise models of quantum hardware. Finally, post-measurement quantization is introduced to quantize the measurement outcomes to discrete values, achieving the denoising effect. Extensive experiments on 8 classification tasks using 6 quantum devices demonstrate that RoQNN improves accuracy by up to 43%, and achieves over 94% 2-class, 80% 4-class, and 34% 10-class MNIST classification accuracy measured on real quantum computers.

Existing regularization techniques (e.g., data augmentation, dropout) have shown much success on large neural networks (e.g., ResNet50) by adding noise to overcome over-fitting. However, we found these techniques hurt the performance of tiny neural networks. We argue that training tiny models are different from large models: rather than augmenting the data, we should augment the model, since tiny models tend to suffer from under-fitting rather than over-fitting due to limited capacity. To alleviate this issue, NetAug augments the network (reverse dropout) instead of inserting noise into the dataset or the network. It puts the tiny model into larger models and encourages it to work as a sub-model of larger models to get extra supervision, in addition to functioning as an independent model. At test time, only the tiny model is used for inference, incurring zero inference overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NetAug on image classification and object detection. NetAug consistently improves the performance of tiny models, achieving up to 2.1% accuracy improvement on ImageNet, and 4.3% on Cars. On Pascal VOC, NetAug provides 2.96% mAP improvement with the same computational cost.\\n        ',\n",

Compared to projecting the point cloud to 2D space, directly processing the 3D point cloud yields higher accuracy and lower #MACs. However, the extremely sparse nature of point cloud poses challenges to hardware acceleration. For example, we need to explicitly determine the nonzero outputs and search for the nonzero neighbors (mapping operation), which is unsupported in existing accelerators.

The key idea of TSM is to shift part of the channels along the temporal dimension, thus facilitate information exchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve temporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. TSM offers several unique advantages.

We prove that the general CRS problem is NP-hard and study two special cases of the CRS problem. The first case restricts the computing and actuating segments to have unit-size execution time while the second case assumes that both sensing and actuating segments have unit-size execution time. We propose an optimal algorithm to solve the first case by checking the intervals with 100% network resource utilization and modify the deadlines of the tasks within those intervals to prune the search. For the second case, we propose another optimal algorithm based on a novel backtracking strategy to check the time intervals with the network resource utilization larger than 100% and modify the timing parameters of tasks based on these intervals. For the general case, we design a greedy strategy to modify the timing parameters of both network segments and computing segments within the time intervals that have network and computing resource utilization larger than 100%, respectively.

Running subsets of the full generator produce outputs that are perceptually similar to the full generator, making them a good proxy for preview. By using sampling-based multi-resolution training, adaptive-channel training, and a generator-conditioned discriminator, the anycost generator can be evaluated at various configurations while achieving better image quality compared to separately trained models. Furthermore, we develop new encoder training and latent code optimization techniques to encourage consistency between the different sub-generators during image projection. Anycost GAN can be executed at various cost budgets (up to 10x computation reduction) and adapt to a wide range of hardware and latency requirements. When deployed on desktop CPUs and edge devices, our model can provide perceptually similar previews at 6-12x speedup, enabling interactive image editing.

However, general-purpose platforms such as CPUs and GPUs are inefficient when performing attention inference due to complicated data movement and low arithmetic intensity. Moreover, existing NN accelerators mainly focus on optimizing convolutional or recurrent models, and cannot efficiently support attention. In this paper, we present SpAtten, an efficient algorithm-architecture co-design that leverages token sparsity, head sparsity, and quantization opportunities to reduce the attention computation and memory access. Inspired by the high redundancy of human languages, we propose the novel cascade token pruning to prune away unimportant tokens in the sentence. We also propose cascade head pruning to remove unessential heads. Cascade pruning is fundamentally different from weight pruning since there is no trainable weight in the attention mechanism, and the pruned tokens and heads are selected on the fly. To efficiently support them on hardware, we design a novel top-k engine to rank token and head importance scores with high throughput. Furthermore, we propose progressive quantization that first fetches MSBs only and performs the computation; if the confidence is low, it fetches LSBs and recomputes the attention outputs, trading computation for memory reduction.\\n  Extensive experiments on 30 benchmarks show that, on average, SpAtten reduces DRAM access by 10.0x with no accuracy loss, and achieves 1.6x, 3.0x, 162x, 347x speedup, and 1,4x, 3.2x, 1193x, 4059x energy savings over A3 accelerator, MNNFast accelerator, TITAN Xp GPU, Xeon CPU, respectively.\\n        ',\n",

This performance gap is more severe under smaller batch sizes. In this work, we extensively study the parallelism between operators and propose Inter-Operator Scheduler (IOS) to automatically schedule multiple operators' parallel execution through a novel dynamic programming algorithm.

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy, and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design.\\n        \",\n",

To this end, we propose Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution (SPVConv), a lightweight 3D module that equips the vanilla Sparse Convolution with the high-resolution point-based branch. With negligible overhead, this point-based branch is able to preserve the fine details even from large outdoor scenes. To explore the spectrum of efficient 3D models, we first define a flexible architecture design space based on SPVConv, and we then present 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture over this diverse design space efficiently and effectively. Experimental results validate that the resulting SPVNAS model is fast and accurate: it outperforms the state-of-the-art MinkowskiNet by 3.3%, ranking 1st on the competitive SemanticKITTI leaderboard. It also achieves 8x computation reduction and 3x measured speedup over MinkowskiNet with higher accuracy.

Extensive experiments show that TinyTL significantly saves the memory (up to 6.5x) with little accuracy loss compared to fine-tuning the full network. Compared to fine-tuning the last layer, TinyTL provides significant accuracy improvements (up to 34.1%) with little memory overhead.

TinyNAS adopts a two-stage neural architecture search approach that first optimizes the search space to fit the resource constraints, then specializes the network architecture in the optimized search space. TinyNAS can automatically handle diverse constraints (i.e.device, latency, energy, memory) under low search costs.TinyNAS is co-designed with TinyEngine, a memory-efficient inference library to expand the search space and fit a larger model. TinyEngine adapts the memory scheduling according to the overall network topology rather than layer-wise optimization, reducing the memory usage by 4.8x, and accelerating the inference by 1.7-3.3x compared to TF-Lite Micro and CMSIS-NN. MCUNet is the first to achieves >70% ImageNet top1 accuracy on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller, using 3.5x less SRAM and 5.7x less Flash compared to quantized MobileNetV2 and ResNet-18.

Previous attempts to directly augment the training data manipulate the distribution of real images, yielding little benefit; DiffAugment enables us to adopt the differentiable augmentation for the generated samples, effectively stabilizes training, and leads to better convergence. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our method over a variety of GAN architectures and loss functions for both unconditional and class-conditional generation. With DiffAugment, we achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 6.80 with an IS of 100.8 on ImageNet 128x128 and 2-4x reductions of FID given 1,000 images on FFHQ and LSUN.

Unlike previous methods that separately search the neural architecture, pruning policy, and quantization policy, we optimize them in a joint manner. To deal with the larger design space it brings, a promising approach is to train a quantization-aware accuracy predictor to quickly get the accuracy of the quantized model and feed it to the search engine to select the best fit. However, training this quantization-aware accuracy predictor requires collecting a large number of quantized <model, accuracy> pairs, which involves quantization-aware finetuning and thus is highly time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we propose to transfer the knowledge from a full-precision (i.e., fp32) accuracy predictor to the quantization-aware (i.e., int8) accuracy predictor, which greatly improves the sample efficiency. Besides, collecting the dataset for the fp32 accuracy predictor only requires to evaluate neural networks without any training cost by sampling from a pretrained once-for-all network, which is highly efficient. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the benefits of our joint optimization approach. With the same accuracy, APQ reduces the latency/energy by 2x/1.3x over MobileNetV2+HAQ. Compared to the separate optimization approach (ProxylessNAS+AMC+HAQ), APQ achieves 2.3% higher ImageNet accuracy while reducing orders of magnitude GPU hours and CO2 emission, pushing the frontier for green AI that is environmental-friendly.

The key primitive is the Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA), where one group of heads specializes in the local context modeling (by convolution) while another group specializes in the long-distance relationship modeling (by attention). Such specialization brings consistent improvement over the vanilla transformer on three well-established language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Under constrained resources (500M/100M MACs), Lite Transformer outperforms transformer on WMT'14 English-French by 1.2/1.7 BLEU, respectively. Lite Transformer reduces the computation of transformer base model by 2.5x with 0.3 BLEU score degradation.

In this work, we propose a general-purpose compression framework for reducing the inference time and model size of the generator in cGANs. Directly applying existing CNNs compression methods yields poor performance due to the difficulty of GAN training and the differences in generator architectures. We address these challenges in two ways. First, to stabilize the GAN training, we transfer knowledge of multiple intermediate representations of the original model to its compressed model, and unify unpaired and paired learning. Second, instead of reusing existing CNN designs, our method automatically finds efficient architectures via neural architecture search (NAS). To accelerate the search process, we decouple the model training and architecture search via weight sharing.

To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a fully distributed packet scheduling framework called FD-PaS. FD-PaS aims to provide guaranteed fast response to unexpected disturbances while achieving minimum performance degradation for meeting the timing and reliability requirements of all critical tasks. To combat the scalability challenge, FD-PaS incorporates several key advances in both algorithm design and data link layer protocol design to enable individual nodes to make on-line decisions locally without any centralized control. Our extensive simulation and testbed results have validated the correctness of the FD-PaS design and demonstrated its effectiveness in providing fast response for handling disturbances while ensuring the designated QoS requirements.\\n        ',\n",

Machine learning is a promising tool to automate this process. However, supervised learning is difficult for this task due to the low availability of training data: 1) Circuit simulation is slow, thus generating large-scale dataset is time-consuming; 2) Most circuit designs are propitiatory IPs within individual IC companies, making it expensive to collect large-scale datasets. We propose Learning to Design Circuits (L2DC) to leverage reinforcement learning that learns to efficiently generate new circuits data and to optimize circuits. We fix the schematic, and optimize the parameters of the transistors automatically by training an RL agent with no prior knowledge about optimizing circuits. After iteratively getting observations, generating a new set of transistor parameters, getting a reward, and adjusting the model, L2DC is able to optimize circuits. We evaluate L2DC on two transimpedance amplifiers. Trained for a day, our RL agent can achieve comparable or better performance than human experts trained for a quarter. It first learns to meet hard-constraints (eg. gain, bandwidth), and then learns to optimize good-to-have targets (eg. area, power). Compared with grid search-aided human design, L2DC can achieve $\\\\mathbf{250}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\times}$ higher sample efficiency with comparable performance. Under the same runtime constraint, the performance of L2DC is also better than Bayesian Optimization.\\n        ',\n",

However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. $10^4$ GPU hours) makes it difficult to \\\\emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize~\\\\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \\\\emph{ProxylessNAS} that can \\\\emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization. On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08\\\\% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6$\\\\times$ fewer parameters. On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1\\\\% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2$\\\\times$ faster with measured GPU latency.

       " \"\\n        Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size, we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits) quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies, which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware architecture design.\\n        \",\n",

Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot capture temporal relationships; 3D CNN based methods can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive, making it expensive to deploy. In this paper, we propose a generic and effective Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that enjoys both high efficiency and high performance. Specifically, it can achieve the performance of 3D CNN but maintain 2D CNN's complexity. TSM shifts part of the channels along the temporal dimension; thus facilitate information exchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve temporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. We also extended TSM to online setting, which enables real-time low-latency online video recognition and video object detection. TSM is accurate and efficient: it ranks the first place on the Something-Something leaderboard upon publication; on Jetson Nano and Galaxy Note8, it achieves a low latency of 13ms and 35ms for online video recognition.

This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection.

This network transformation allows reusing previously trained networks and existing successful architectures that improves sample efficiency. We aim to address the limitation of current network transformation operations that can only perform layer-level architecture modifications, such as adding (pruning) filters or inserting (removing) a layer, which fails to change the topology of connection paths. Our proposed path-level transformation operations enable the meta-controller to modify the path topology of the given network while keeping the merits of reusing weights, and thus allow efficiently designing effective structures with complex path topologies like Inception models. We further propose a bidirectional tree-structured reinforcement learning meta-controller to explore a simple yet highly expressive tree-structured architecture space that can be viewed as a generalization of multi-branch architectures. We experimented on the image classification datasets with limited computational resources (about 200 GPU-hours), where we observed improved parameter efficiency and better test results (97.70% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 14.3M parameters and 74.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in the mobile setting), demonstrating the effectiveness and transferability of our designed architectures.\\n        ',\n",

While we focus on a specific example, the lessons are far-reaching. We develop a package based on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) called hls4ml to build machine learning models in FPGAs. The use of HLS increases accessibility across a broad user community and allows for a drastic decrease in firmware development time. We map out FPGA resource usage and latency versus neural network hyperparameters to identify the problems in particle physics that would benefit from performing neural network inference with FPGAs. For our example jet substructure model, we fit well within the available resources of modern FPGAs with a latency on the scale of 100 ns.\\n        ',\n",

Analytics applications process the data, and provide results offline or in a time period that is considerably slow in comparison to the performance of the manufacturing process. Along with the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the introduction of \"pervasive sensors\" technology in process industries, increasing number of sensors and actuators are installed in process plants for pervasive sensing and control, and the volume of produced process data is growing exponentially. To digest these data and meet the ever-growing requirements to increase production efficiency and improve product quality, there needs to be a way to both improve the performance of the analytics system and scale the system to closely monitor a much larger set of plant resources.

Direct interrogation of such interactions is often difficult or impossible. Structured electromagnetic systems offer a rich toolkit for mimicking and reproducing the key dynamics that governs the microscopic interactions, and thus provide an avenue to explore and interpret the microscopic phenomena. In particular, metamaterials offer the freedom to artificially tailor light-matter coupling and to control the interaction between unit cells in the metamaterial array. Here we demonstrate a terahertz metamaterial that mimics spin-related interactions of microscopic particles in a 2D lattice via complex electromagnetic multipole interactions within the metamaterial array. Fano resonances featured by distinct mode properties due to strong nearest-neighbor interactions are discussed that draw parallels with the 2D Ising model. Interestingly, a hyperfine Fano splitting spectrum is observed by manipulating the 2D interactions without applying external magnetic or electric fields, which provides a passive multispectral platform for applications in super-resolution imaging, biosensing, and selective thermal emission.

We further developed automated algorithms for measuring saccade latency and error rate that take into account the possibility that it might not always be possible to determine the eye movement from app-based recordings. Results: To measure saccade latency on a tablet, we ensured that the absolute timing error between on-screen task presentation and the camera recording is within 5 ms. We collected over 235,000 eye movements in 80 subjects ranging in age from 20 to 92 years, with 96% of recorded eye movements either declared good or directional errors. Our error detection code achieved a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. Confirming prior reports, we observed a positive correlation between saccade latency and age while the relationship between error rate and age was not significant. Finally, we observed significant intra- and inter-subject variations in saccade latency and error rate distributions, which highlights the importance of individualized tracking of these visual digital biomarkers. Conclusion and Significance: Our system and algorithms allow ubiquitous tracking of saccade latency and error rate, which opens up the possibility of quantifying patient state on a finer timescale in a broader population than previously possible.\\n        ',\n",

A probability distribution on the set of order ideals of P is toggle-symmetric if for every p in P, the probability that p is maximal in I equals the probability that p is minimal not in I. In this paper, we prove a formula for the expected jaggedness of an order ideal of P under any toggle-symmetric probability distribution when P is the poset of boxes in a skew Young diagram. Our result extends the main combinatorial theorem of Chan-L√≥pez-Pflueger-Teixidor, who used an expected jaggedness computation as a key ingredient to prove an algebro-geometric formula; and it has applications to homomesies, in the sense of Propp-Roby, of the antichain cardinality statistic for order ideals in partially ordered sets.\\n        ',\n",

Recently, Perkinson, Yang, and Yu gave a bijective proof of this equality that moreover generalizes to graphical parking functions. Using a depth-first search variant of Dhar\\'s burning algorithm they proved that the codegree enumerator for $G$-parking functions equals the $Œ∫$-number enumerator for spanning trees of $G$. The $Œ∫$-number is a kind of generalized tree inversion number originally defined by Gessel. We extend the work of Perkinson-Yang-Yu to what are referred to as \"generalized parking functions\" in the literature, but which we prefer to call vector parking functions because they depend on a choice of vector $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^n$. Specifically, we give an expression for the reversed sum enumerator for $\\\\mathbf{x}$-parking functions in terms of inversions in rooted plane trees with respect to certain admissible vertex orders.

This work unifies and extends earlier results for fourientations due to Gessel and Sagan, and results for partial orientations due to the first author, and the second author and David Perkinson, as well as results for total orientations due to many authors. We conclude by describing how these classes of fourientations relate to geometric, combinatorial, and algebraic objects including bigraphical arrangements, cycle-cocycle reversal systems, graphic Lawrence ideals, Riemann-Roch theory for graphs, zonotopal algebras, and the reliability polynomial.\\n        ',\n",

We show that indeed these relations follow from the Pl√ºcker relations in the Grassmannian together with some simple rank properties of the matrices corresponding to our interlacing networks. The space of matrices obeying these rank properties forms the closure of a cell in the matroid stratification of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. Not only does the octahedron recurrence for RSK follow immediately from the three-term relations for interlacing networks, but also these relations imply some interesting identities of Schur functions reminiscent of those obtained by Fulmek and Kleber.

In this paper, we explore how convolutions are used in fundamental machine vision applications. We present an accelerated n-dimensional convolution package in the high performance computing language, Julia, and demonstrate its efficacy in solving the time to contact problem for machine vision. Results are measured against synthetically generated videos and quantitatively assessed according to their mean squared error from the ground truth.

However, as the s-SNOM technique marches into the far-infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) regimes, emerging experiments sometimes produce puzzling results. For example, anomalies in the near-field optical contrast have been widely reported. In this Letter, we systematically investigate a series of extreme subwavelength metallic nanostructures via s-SNOM near-field imaging in the GHz to THz frequency range. We find that the near-field material contrast is greatly impacted by the lateral size of the nanostructure, while the spatial resolution is practically independent of it. The contrast is also strongly affected by the connectivity of the metallic structures to a larger metallic ground plane. The observed effect can be largely explained by a quasi-electrostatic analysis. We also compare the THz s-SNOM results to those of the mid-IR regime, where the size-dependence becomes significant only for smaller structures. Our results reveal that the quantitative analysis of the near-field optical material contrasts in the long-wavelength regime requires a careful assessment of the size and configuration of metallic (optically conductive) structures.\\n        ',\n",

At terahertz wavelengths, it has emerged as a prominent tool for a number of applications, ranging from non-ionizing cancer diagnosis and pharmaceutical characterization to non-destructive artifact testing. Contemporary terahertz imaging systems typically rely on non-linear optical down-conversion of a fiber-based near-infrared femtosecond laser, requiring complex optical systems. Here, we demonstrate hyperspectral imaging with chip-scale frequency combs based on terahertz quantum cascade lasers. The dual combs are free-running and emit coherent terahertz radiation that covers a bandwidth of 220 GHz at 3.4 THz with ~10 ŒºW per line.

Commonly OFCs are generated in nonlinear media from a monochromatic narrow linewidth laser sources or from a mode-locked laser pulses but in the all-important mid-infrared (MIR) and terahertz (THz) regions of spectrum OFCs can be generated intrinsically by the free-running quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with high efficiency. These combs do not look like conventional OFCs as the phases of each mode are different and in temporal domain the OFC is a seemingly random combination of amplitude- and phase-modulated signals rather than a short pulse. Despite this pseudo-randomness, the experimental evidence suggests that the linewidth of the QCL OFC is just as narrow as that of a QCL operating in the single mode. While universally acknowledged, this seemingly observation is not fully understood. In this work we rigorously prove this fact by deriving the expression for the Schawlow-Townes linewidth of QCL OFC and offer a transparent physical interpretation based on orthogonality of laser modes, indicating that despite their very different temporal profiles MIR and THz QCL OFCs are just as good for most applications as any other OFC.\\n        ',\n",

Magnetoplasmons (MPs), as high-frequency density excitations of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a perpendicular magnetic field, embody a prototype of band topology for bosons. The time-reversal-breaking magnetic field opens a topological gap for bulk MPs up to the cyclotron frequency; topologically-protected edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs) bridge the bulk gap and propagate unidirectionally along system's boundaries. However, all the EMPs known to date adhere to physical edges where the electron density terminates abruptly. This restriction has made device application extremely difficult. Here we demonstrate a new class of topological edge plasmons -- domain-boundary magnetoplasmons (DBMPs), within a uniform edgeless 2DEG. Such DBMPs arise at the domain boundaries of an engineered sign-changing magnetic field and are protected by the difference of gap Chern numbers (+/-1) across the magnetic domains. They propagate unidirectionally along the domain boundaries and are immune to domain defects. Moreover, they exhibit wide tunability in the microwave frequency range under an applied magnetic field or gate voltage.

In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to extract the phase and timing signals of a multiheterodyne spectrum completely computationally, without any extra measurements or optical elements. These techniques are viable even when the relative linewidth exceeds the repetition rate difference, and can tremendously simplify any dual comb system.

In this paper, we verify for the first time that when a 2DMA is placed at a nanometric distance from a metallic substrate, the strong and coherent interaction between the dipoles inside the 2DMA dominates its fluorescent decay at picosecond timescale. Our streak-camera lifetime measurement and interacting lattice-dipole calculation reveal that the metal-mediated dipole-dipole interaction shortens the fluorescent lifetime to about one half and increases the energy dissipation rate by ten times than expected from the noninteracting single-dipole picture.

It reveals that due to the low metal-to-dielectric work function at such interfaces, conduction electrons can display a drastic quantum spillover, causing the interfacial electron-hole pair production to dominate the decay of surface plasmons.

Here we demonstrate that by cascading nano-corrugation gratings with different periodicities on silver nanowires atop silicon, different colors can be spatially separated and chronologically released at different grating junctions. The released light frequency depends on the grating arrangement and corrugation periodicities. Hence the nanowire acts as a spectral splitter for sorting/demultiplexing photons at different nano-scale positions with a ten-femtosecond-level interval. Such nanowires can be constructed further into compact 2D networks or circuits.

The SB intensity is a sensitive track of the polariton density and they can be detected down to a quantum noise floor that is more than 2500 times lower than the excitation thresholds of comparable quantum cascade laser diodes.

In the first part of the paper, we use a three-level density-matrix model to obtain useful analytical expressions for current transport through the injector barrier in a QCL. An expression for the slope discontinuity in the current-voltage characteristics at the lasing threshold is derived.

In the second part of the paper, we use density matrices to compute the gain spectrum for a resonant-phonon terahertz QCL design.

We find that the group decision-making at the heart of this process exhibits several fundamental forms of relative assessment. First we observe that the chance that a voter will support a candidate is strongly dependent on the relationship between characteristics of the voter and the candidate.

However, contrastive learning is susceptible to shortcuts - i.e., it may learn shortcut features irrelevant to the task of interest, and discard relevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted data augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. But, manually crafted augmentations do not work across all datasets and tasks. Further, data augmentations fail in addressing shortcuts in multi-attribute classification when one attribute acts as a shortcut around other attributes. In this paper, we analyze the objective function of contrastive learning and formally prove that it is vulnerable to shortcuts. We then present reconstructive contrastive learning (RCL), a framework for learning unsupervised representations that are robust to shortcuts. The key idea is to force the learned representation to reconstruct the input, which naturally counters potential shortcuts.

The algorithm uses a training set of input matrices in order to optimize its performance. Specifically, some of the most efficient approximate algorithms for computing low-rank approximations proceed by computing a projection $SA$, where $S$ is a sparse random $m \\\\times n$ \"sketching matrix\", and then performing the singular value decomposition of $SA$. We show how to replace the random matrix $S$ with a \"learned\" matrix of the same sparsity to reduce the error.\\n  Our experiments show that, for multiple types of data sets, a learned sketch matrix can substantially reduce the approximation loss compared to a random matrix $S$, sometimes by one order of magnitude. We also study mixed matrices where only some of the rows are trained and the remaining ones are random, and show that matrices still offer improved performance while retaining worst-case guarantees.\\n  Finally, to understand the theoretical aspects of our approach, we study the special case of $m=1$. In particular, we give an approximation algorithm for minimizing the empirical loss, with approximation factor depending on the stable rank of matrices in the training set.

Two of the most popular algorithms for this problem, Count-Min and Count-Sketch, are widely used in practice.\\n  In a recent work [Hsu et al., ICLR'19], it was shown empirically that augmenting Count-Min and Count-Sketch with a machine learning algorithm leads to a significant reduction of the estimation error. The experiments were complemented with an analysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min (both the standard and the augmented version) when the input frequencies follow a Zipfian distribution. Although the authors established that the learned version of Count-Min has lower estimation error than its standard counterpart, their analysis of the standard Count-Min algorithm was not tight. Moreover, they provided no similar analysis for Count-Sketch.\\n  In this paper we resolve these problems. First, we provide a simple tight analysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min. Second, we provide the first error bounds for both the standard and the augmented version of Count-Sketch. These bounds are nearly tight and again demonstrate an improved performance of the learned version of Count-Sketch.\\n  In addition to demonstrating tight gaps between the aforementioned algorithms, we believe that our bounds for the standard versions of Count-Min and Count-Sketch are of independent interest. In particular, it is a typical practice to set the number of hash functions in those algorithms to $Œò(\\\\log n)$. In contrast, our results show that to minimize the \\\\emph{expected} error, the number of hash functions should be a constant, strictly greater than $1$.\\n        \",\n",

In the first step, the pointset is partitioned into subsets called fairlets that satisfy the fairness requirement and approximately preserve the $k$-median objective. In the second step, fairlets are merged into $k$ clusters by one of the existing $k$-median algorithms. The running time of this algorithm is dominated by the first step, which takes super-quadratic time.\\n  In this paper, we present a practical approximate fairlet decomposition algorithm that runs in nearly linear time.

Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the transmitter and receiver need to align their antenna beams before they can communicate. Existing solutions scan the entire space to find the best alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay, and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly switch between users and accommodate mobile clients.\\n  This paper presents Rapid-Link, a new protocol that can find the best mmWave beam alignment without scanning the space. Given all possible directions for setting the antenna beam, Rapid-Link provably finds the optimal direction in logarithmic number of measurements. Further, Rapid-Link works within the existing 802.11ad standard for mmWave LAN, and can support both clients and access points. We have implemented Rapid-Link in a mmWave radio and evaluated it empirically. Our results show that it reduces beam alignment delay by orders of magnitude.

Our results hold for expressions involving concatenation, OR, Kleene star and Kleene plus. For regular expressions of depth two (involving any combination of the above operators), we show the following dichotomy: matching and membership testing can be solved in near-linear time, except for \"concatenations of stars\", which cannot be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For regular expressions of depth three the picture is more complex. Nevertheless, we show that all problems can either be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time, or cannot be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time assuming SETH.\\n  An intriguing special case of membership testing involves regular expressions of the form \"a star of an OR of concatenations\", e.g., $[a|ab|bc]^*$.

Specifically, we show that, if the edit distance can be computed in time $O(n^{2-Œ¥})$ for some constant $Œ¥>0$, then the satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulas with $N$ variables and $M$ clauses can be solved in time $M^{O(1)} 2^{(1-Œµ)N}$ for a constant $Œµ>0$. The latter result would violate the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, which postulates that such algorithms do not exist.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Compressive Sensing (CS) stipulates that a sparse signal can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements, and that this recovery can be performed efficiently in polynomial time. The framework of model-based compressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and prescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even further. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the model-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model that is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be computationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not sufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection problem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting models.\\n  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call approximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes a range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate solutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the aforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending the applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate this new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which is particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero coefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal) location. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization and the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph optimization techniques. Leveraging these algorithms into our framework results in a nearly sample-optimal sparse recovery scheme for the CEMD model.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We give an algorithm for $\\\\ell_2/\\\\ell_2$ sparse recovery from Fourier measurements using $O(k\\\\log N)$ samples, matching the lower bound of \\\\cite{DIPW} for non-adaptive algorithms up to constant factors for any $k\\\\leq N^{1-Œ¥}$. The algorithm runs in $\\\\tilde O(N)$ time. Our algorithm extends to higher dimensions, leading to sample complexity of $O_d(k\\\\log N)$, which is optimal up to constant factors for any $d=O(1)$. These are the first sample optimal algorithms for these problems.\\n  A preliminary experimental evaluation indicates that our algorithm has empirical sampling complexity comparable to that of other recovery methods known in the literature, while providing strong provable guarantees on the recovery quality.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        We present a new data structure for the c-approximate near neighbor problem (ANN) in the Euclidean space. For n points in R^d, our algorithm achieves O(n^œÅ + d log n) query time and O(n^{1 + œÅ} + d log n) space, where œÅ<= 7/(8c^2) + O(1 / c^3) + o(1). This is the first improvement over the result by Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 2006) and the first data structure that bypasses a locality-sensitive hashing lower bound proved by O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (ICS 2011). By a standard reduction we obtain a data structure for the Hamming space and \\\\ell_1 norm with œÅ<= 7/(8c) + O(1/c^{3/2}) + o(1), which is the first improvement over the result of Indyk and Motwani (STOC 1998).\\n        \",\n",
