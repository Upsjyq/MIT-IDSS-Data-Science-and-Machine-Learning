    "## Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a huge demand for used cars in developing economies, such as the Indian car market. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past years and is larger than the new car market now. Cars4U is a budding Indian tech start-up that aims to find a good strategy in this market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones. Unlike new cars, where price and supply are fairly deterministic and managed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer / except for dealership level discounts which come into play only in the last stage of the customer journey), used cars are very different beasts with huge uncertainty in both pricing and supply. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a senior data scientist at Cars4U, you have to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing. For example, if the business knows the market price, it will never sell anything below it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **The objectives:**\n",
    "* Explore and visualize the dataset.\n",
    "* Build a model to predict the prices of used cars.\n",
    "* Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The key questions:**\n",
    "* Which factors would affect the price of used cars?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The problem formulation**:\n",
    "We have a regression problem at hand where we will try to predict the price of used cars based on several factors such as - Year of manufacturing, Number of seats, Mileage of car, etc.\n",
