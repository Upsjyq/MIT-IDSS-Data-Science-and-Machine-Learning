    "# Star Hotels Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers’ booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:\n",
    "1. Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n",
    "2. Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n",
    "3. Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.\n",
    "4. Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. Star Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",

    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The lead time and the number of special requests made by the customer play a key role in identifying if a booking will be cancelled or not. Bookings where a customer has made a special request and the booking was done under 150 days to the date of arrival are less likely to be canceled.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using this information, the hotel can take the following actions:\n",
    "        * Set up a system that can send a prompt like an automated email to the customers before the arrival date asking for a  re-confirmation of their booking and any changes they would like to make in their bookings.\n",
    "        * Remind guests about imminent deadlines.\n",
    " \n",
    "The response given by the customer will give the hotel ample time to re-sell the room or make preparations for the customers' requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stricter cancellation policies can be adopted by the hotel. \n",
    "    * The bookings where the average price per room is high, and there were special requests associated should not get a full refund as the loss of resources will be high in these cases.\n",
    "    * Ideally the cancellation policies should be consistent across all market segments but as noticed in our analysis high percentage of bookings done online are cancelled. The booking cancelled online should yield less percentage of refund to the customers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The refunds, cancellation fee, etc should be highlighted on the website/app before a customer confirms their booking to safeguard guests' interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The length of stay at the hotel can be restricted.\n",
    "    * We saw in our analysis that bookings, where the total length of stay was more than 5 days, had higher chances of getting cancelled.\n",
    "    * Hotel can allow bookings up to 5 days only and then customers should be asked to re-book if they wish to stay longer. These policies can be relaxed for corporate and Aviation market segments. For other market segments, the process should be fairly easy to not hamper their experience with the hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such restrictions can be strategized by the hotel to generate additional revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the months November, December, and January cancellation to non-cancellation ratio is low. Customers might travel to celebrate Christmas and New Year. The hotel should ensure that enough human resources are available to cater to the needs of the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. July and August saw the highest number of bookings but also the highest number of cancellations. This should be investigated further by the hotel. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Post-booking interactions can be initiated with the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Post-booking interactions will show the guests the level of attention and care they would receive at the hotel. \n",
    "    * To give guests a personalized experience, information about local events, nearby places to explore, etc can be shared from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Improving the experience of repeated customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Our analysis shows that there are very few repeated customers and the cancellation among them is very less which is a good indication as repeat customers are important for the hospitality industry as they can help in spreading the word of mouth.\n",
    "    * A loyal guest is usually more profitable for the business because they are more familiar with offerings from the hotel they have visited before.\n",
    "    * Attracting new customers is tedious and costs more as compared to a repeated guest.\n",
    "    * A loyalty program that offers - special discounts, access to services in hotels, etc for these customers can help in improving their experience."
